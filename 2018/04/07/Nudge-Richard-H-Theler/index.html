        <p>Libertarian paternalism</p>
<p>Improving Decisions about health, wealth, and happiness</p>
<p>Simply by rearranging the cafeteria, Carolyn was able to increase or decrease the consumption of many food items by as much as 25 percent. Carolyn learned a big lesson: school children, like adults, can be greatly influenced by small changes in the context. The influence can be exercised for better or for worse.</p>
<p>A choice architect has the responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions.</p>
<p>As we shall see, small and apparently insignificant details can have major impacts on people’s behavior. A good rule of thumb is to assume that ‘everything matters’.</p>
<p>‘Libertarian paternalism’ is a relatively weak, soft, and nonintrusive type of paternalism because choices are not blocked, fenced off, or significantly burdened.</p>
<p>A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.</p>
<p>Nudges are not mandates.</p>
<p>Hundreds of studies confirm that human forecasts are flawed and biased. Human decision making is not so great either.</p>
<p>For a host of reasons, which we shall explore, people have a strong tendency to go along with the status quo or default option.</p>
<p>Two important lessons can be drawn from this research. First, never underestimate the power of inertia. Second, that power can be harnessed. As we will show, setting default options, and other similar seemingly trivial menu-changing strategies, can have huge effects on outcomes, from increasing savings to improving health care to providing organs for lifesaving transplant operations.</p>
<p>In accordance with our definition, a nudge is any factor that significantly alters the behavior of Humans, even though it would be ignored by Econs.</p>
<p>The false assumption is that almost all people, almost all of the time, make choices that are in their best interest or at the very least are better than the choices that would be made by someone else.</p>
<p>The first misconception is that it is possible to avoid influencing people’s choices. The second misconception is that paternalism always involves coercion.</p>
<p>Automatic system and reflective system</p>
<p>Rules of thumb<br>Their original work identified three heuristics, or rules of thumb – anchoring, availability, and representativeness – and the biases that are associated with each.</p>
<p>Unrealistic optimism is a pervasive feature of human life; it characterizes most people in most social categories. When they overestimate their personal immunity from harm, people may fail to take sensible preventive steps.</p>
<p>People are ‘loss averse’.</p>
<p>The combination of loss aversion with mindless choosing implies that if an option is designated as the ‘default’, it will attract a large market share. Default options thus act as powerful nudges.</p>
<p>Framing works because people tend to be somewhat mindless, passive decision makers. Their reflective system does not do the work that would be required to check and see whether reframing the questions would produce a different answer.</p>
<p>We will call something ‘tempting’ if we consume more of it when hot than when cold.</p>
<p>When self-control problems and mindless choosing are combined, the result is a series of bad outcomes for real people.</p>
<p>Humans are not exactly lemmings, but they are easily influenced by the statements and deeds of others.</p>
<p>Social influences come in two basic categories. The first involves information. The second involves peer pressure.</p>
<p>The moral is that people are paying less attention to you than you believe. If you have a stain on your shirt, don’t worry, they probably won’t notice. But in part because people do think that everyone has their eyes fixed on them, they conform to what they think people expect.</p>
<p>In particular, advertisers are entirely aware of the power of social influences. They try to nudge you by telling you what most people are now doing.</p>
<p>Boomerang effect<br>If you want to nudge people into socially desirable behavior, do not, by any means, let them know that their current actions are better than the social norm.</p>
<p>The ‘mere-measurement effect’ refers to the finding that when people are asked what they intend to do, they become more likely to act in accordance with their answers.</p>
<p>The three social influences that we have emphasized – information, peer pressure, and priming – can easily be enlisted by private and public nudgers.</p>
<p>If you indirectly influence the choices oher people make, you are a choice architect. And since the choices you are influencing are going to be made by Humans, you will want your architecture to reflect a good understanding of how humans behave.</p>
<p>All these forces imply that if, for a given choice, there is a default option – an option that will obtain if the chooser does nothing – then we can expect a large number of people to end up with that option, whether or not it is good for them.</p>
<p>When choices are highly complex, required choosing may not be a good idea; it might not even be feasible.</p>
<p>Humans make mistakes. A well-designed system expects its users to err and is as forgiving as possible. </p>
<p>The best way to help Humans improve their performance is to provide feedback. Well-designed systems tell people when they are doing well and when they are making mistakes.</p>
<p>President Bush told a clubhouse of Florida seniors in 2006, with the plan’s rollout under way: ‘The more choices you have, the more likely it is you’ll be able to find a program that suits your specific needs. In other words, one-size-fits-all is not a consumer-friendly program. And I believe in consumers, I believe in trusting people’.</p>
<p>The more choices there are, and the more complex the situation, the more important it is to have enlightened choices architecture. To produce a user-friendly design, the architect needs to understand how to help Humans.</p>
<p>In this book we have made two major claims. The first is that seemingly small features of social situations can have massive effects on people’s behavior; nudges are everywhere, even if we do not see them. Choice architecture, both good and bad, is pervasive and unavoidable, and it greatly affects our decisions. Choice archetects can preserve freedom of choice while also nudging people in directions that will improve their lives.</p>
<p>The sheer complexity of modern life, and the astounding pace of technological and global change, undermine arguments for rigid mandates or for dogmatic laissez-faire. Emerging developments should strengthen, at once, the principled commitment to freedom of choice and the case for the gentle nudge.</p>
