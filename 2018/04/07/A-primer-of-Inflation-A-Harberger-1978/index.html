        <p>I have for this purpose defined chronic inflation as a condition in which price increases of more than 20 percent per annum have been typical over an extended period.</p>
<p>Two key lessons flow from Table 1.<br>The first is that there is a close relationship between the rate of inflation and the rate of increase in the money supply.<br>The second is that the rate of increase of prices.</p>
<p>However, we know too, from common sense and from experience, that inflation operates as a tax on holdings of money. Thus it is also reasonable that the size of real cash balances should be less in an inflationary environment than it would be if there were little or no inflation. This tendency for inflation itself to lead people to economize on their holdings of cash does not show up in the data for chronic inflations. This can be explained in either of two ways.<br>First, people reduce their cash balances in the process of adapting to an inflationary situation. Once they have made their adaption – say by reducing their average bank balance from six weeks’ income to four weeks’ income, they will tend to stay at the new level unless the rate of inflation goes up. Therefore if we observe a country that has an inflation rate of 30 percent per year in the mid-1950s, and continues oscillating around that level into the mid 1960s, we should not expect people to be reducing their real cash holdings in the interim. The reduction would have occurred earlier – in the process of getting from zero or low rates of inflation up to 30 percent.<br>The second reason underlying the observation that the money supply has risen more rapidly than the price level during periods of chronic inflation is simply that the forces of population growth and rising real income levels continue to work even in an inflationary setting. Their effects cumulate through time, and when a long span of years is involved they can easily outweigh the tendency for an increased rate of inflation to cause people to reduce their cash holdings.</p>
<p>Thus we have (1) similarity of rates within each period among the industrial countries, (2) similarity of rates within each period between the selected LDC’s and the industrial countries, and (3) a significant change in the pace of inflation between periods. I believe that one must recognize from these figures the validity of the notion of a ‘world inflation.’ It is not by accident that so many countries have moved, almost in lock-step, through successive, closely similar inflationary experiences. Much more plausible is the idea that they were co-participants in a common process of world inflation.</p>
<p>This interpretation is further strengthened when it is realized that for most of the period under review the bulk of the world was on a system of fixed exchange rates. And just as the cause of inflation in Illinois cannot differ much from that of inflation in Ohio, so long as both states share a common currency and allow goods and services to move freely in and out, so too the cause of inflation in Costa Rica or Iran or the Philippines cannot be very different from that of the ‘world inflation’ so long as they maintain a fixed exchange rate with the major currencies, and so long as they do not introduce dramatic new interferences with the movement of goods and services.</p>
<p>Then in the period since 1973 the major currencies have all floated vis-avis one another, making the notion of a world money supply even more of an abstraction. Yet I still believe that the notion is a good one, generating insights that lead to more fruitful interpretations of reality than the alternative of assuming that each country’s monetary authorities behaved independently. Even though we have ahd nearly five years of floating rates, it is my impression that the monetary authorities of the major countries have behaved with far less independence than the theorists of floating rates are prone to assume. Consequently, in terms of the way the international monetary system has worked since 1973, I would characterize it as a hybrid, functioning if anything more like a fixed-exchange-rate system than like a textbook case of floating rates.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, then, a government intent on borrowing from the banking system at a rate more rapid than that compatible with stable prices, is going to have to expand the money supply at an inflationary pace. This has been the historic source of nearly all chronic and acute inflations.</p>
<p>The reasons why private-sector credit inflations get started (and keep going) are harder to understand than those relating to inflations caused principally by fiscal deficits. Usually there is some entity that has the power to expand credit without being subject to stern control by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The thought is that credit which is for productive purposes is not inflationary, a notion sometimes dubbed ‘the real bills doctrine.’ Plausible though it may appear at first glance, the proposition does not survive close examination. A country’s money supply will typically be equal to something between one and two months’ income. An effort to extend credit equal to even three or four months’ production would be frustrated by inflation, unless the credit came from outside the monetary system. This is so simply because people would not be willing to hold three or four months’ income in the form of money balances.</p>
<p>The rapid rise in international reserves, which started in 1969, stemmed from a variety of causes. The expansion of the supply of United States dollars (which have been for half a century the key currency in the international system) accelerated somewhat under the strains of the Vietnam War. Simutaneously, the world banking system created important new supplies of dollars (Eurodollars) and of some other currencies (German marks, Swiss francs) as it expanded its lending operations denominated in these moneys. Quite independently, but more or less at the same time, there was a significant growth of SDRs (Special Drawing Rights), the new ‘world money’ created within and by the International Monetary Fund to add to the supply of international reserves. Finally, in the mid-1970s there was an expansion of lending by the International Monetary Fund to the Central Banks of its member countries, most of it under the rubric of the IMF Oil Facility, a series of credits advanced to the countries that were hardest hit by the dramatic oil price rise of 1974.</p>
<p>Three effects now enter the picture, all produced by the disequilibrium situation just described:<br>a) People will attempt to reconstitute the shortfall in their real cash balances, simply by spending less than normal for a time. Part of this reduction in spending will fall on purely domestic goods, but part will fall on traded goods, thus inducing a tendency to surplus in the balance of payments and a consequent ‘importation of money.’<br>b) People will also attempt to reconstitute their shortfall of real cash by borrowing. This can be accomplished either through the domestic monetary authorities permitting the expnsion of credit (and money supply), or through borrowing from abroad. If the domestic expansion takes place rapidly enough, this can forestall all the other adjustment mechanisms by itself ‘financing’ a rise of domestic goods prices to match that of traded goods. But to the extent borrowing from abroad is also involved, this second avenue of adjustment also entails an ‘importation of money.’<br>c) Finally, to the extent that neither (a) nor (b) succeeds in rapidly bringing domestic prices into line with world prices, there will be a substitution effect at work, causing people to shift their expenditures away from internationally traded and toward purely domestic goods and services, once again producing an improvement in the balance of payments and an ‘importation of money.’</p>
