        <p>Democracy is the sort of force that has been constantly expanded by the development of history; it is something that in itself requires creativity, renewal, and advancement in broader contexts and in more concrete ways. Because of this, when I say we need a democratic practice to cope with the problems that now face us, the democracy I am referring to – even though it includes the sum, the reflection on, and the development of all historical instances of democracy – by no means refers to a ready made pattern that can be readily copied. Rather, it should be a creative process, a broad social reality that takes into account specific political, economic, and cultural practices. It is precisely for this reason that I have attempted to see the predicament facing China and the crises afflicting the rest of the contemporary world – including the so called democratic Western world – as different facets of an interrelated historical process.</p>
<p>Like much contemporary Western analysis of this transformation, Wang’s account focuses on what are most often taken in the West as the contradictions of the process, notably rapid economic deregulation conjoined with a still highly intrusive state.</p>
<p>(Theodore Huters)<br>The creation of today’s market society was not the result of a sequence of spontaneous events, but rather of state interference and violence. In other words, were there no governments to set the terms and guarantee the structure of the markets that the advocates of this system – the neoliberals – claim to be regulated only by a Smithian invisible hand, these institutions would not have come into existence in the first place, could neither sustain themselves nor function as they do. This has marked a fundamental change in the world: ‘the core of the neoliral conception of globalization…no longer recognizes the division between politics and economic characteristic of the nineteenth century, but rather envisions the workings of the economy, markets, and capital as replacing the political and social spheres.’</p>
<p>Those in charge of implementing the last will and testament of the revolution [that is, the Party leadership] carry out their dual responsibilities in an absurd fashion: on the one hand they clownishly bury all of the reasonable aspects of the revolution and of socialism, while on the other they employ state violence and monopolization to guarantee the smooth transition of a Chinese economy in crisis to one based on market mechanisms, in the process wrecking all of the equitable features of the social guarantees contained within the old system.</p>
<p>The most one can say about the conflict between the Chinese version of neoliberalism and the ultraconservative state ideological apparatus is that it reflects an internal contradiction in the functioning of the state. While neoliberalism takes every opportunity to cast itself in the image of ‘resister’, this does not prove that this ideology of the market is in actual opposition to the practical operations of the state: on the contrary, the state and neoliberalism exist in a complex relationship of codependence.</p>
<p>There are many profound cautionary tales to be learned from Chinese socialism, but these lessons have nothing to do with the realization of egalitarianism. Quite on the contrary, they stemmed from the failure of its egalitarian objectives ever to be really implemented. In other words, what deserves criticism is not the victories won by the socialist movement in the realm of equality, but the new hierarchy and notions of social status that were created in the process.</p>
<p>It is clear that in different parts of the contemporary world, such as North America, Western Europe, Russia, and China, neoliberalism has its own historical roots and social patterns. These differences in historical circumstance have determined that there is no way to adduce convincing conclusions by merely summing up the character of neoliberalism at an abstract level.</p>
<p>The simultaneous existence of planned pricing and market pricing provided perfect conditions for corruption and official peculation.</p>
<p>The social contradiations of 1989 should not be understood as the state promoting reform and various elements of society opposing it, but rather as people demanding even greater reform, given the decline of the old system. The crux of the problem lay in specifying the shape that reform would take. Regardless of whether we are talking about students, intellectuals, or any others who participated in the movement in support of reform (political or economic) and demands for democracy, their hopes for and understanding of reform were extraordinarily diverse. When looked at from a broader or synthetic perspective, however, the reforms the greater part of the populace hoped for and their ideals of democracy and rule by law were for the purpose of guaranteeing social justice and the democratization of economic life through the restructuring of politics and the legal system. They did not wish for a set of political procdures and legal stipulations that were intended merely to demonstrate the legitimacy of carving up social assets as they existed at the time.</p>
<p>Any critical perspective on the problems of contemporary China should not cover up the amazing achievements brought about through this process of reform. In undertaking a historical analysis, however, we cannot ignore the profound and complicated consequences and historical imprints left by the state ideology.</p>
<p>Local and Beijing based interest groups welcomed the new initiative because new reforms signaled further devolution, which meant resolution of the contradictions that had arisen in the period of adjustment between central control and local interests.<br>The intellectuals welcomed the new initiative because they believed that as long as reforms were implemented and a market economy was created, then progress toward democracy in China would eventually take place.<br>Foreign public opinion welcomed this initiative because it meant that China was once again moving toward the fixed objective of ‘the end of history’.</p>
<p>The discourse of ‘the end of history’ that followed upon 1989, however, provided a clear-cut explanation of the events of that year: namely, that it represented the final victory of the Western social system, with China as werely an isolated and incomplete historical instance.</p>
<p>Should neoliberalism’s market program suddenly result in an economic crisis, it could lead to calls for protectionism and isolationism. The historical experiences of Asia and Europe all show that the strengthening of economic relations does not necessarily lead to peace, unity, and integration, and the crises created by market ideology can frequently lead to conflict and isolation; all sorts of ‘scared alliances’ have been formed with resistance, throttling of competition, protectionism, and war as their motives. Thus, critism of neoliberalism is not a rejection of free exchange and free trade, but rather rejection of the closures, protectionism, isolation, and tendencies toward conflict concealed in its developmental logic.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the discussion of practical matters cannot avoid returning to more theoretical and comprehensive reflections, since the crux of today’s problems cannot be seperated into isolated components. The discussion must root itself deeply in the internal logic of modern society, because if it fails to think things through at this level, a social movement of resistance and the critical thinking that goes along with it run the risk of slipping into the logic of that which they are resisting in the first place.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Chinese government’s persevering support for socilism does not pose an obstacle to the following conclusion: in all of its behaviors, including economic, politicl, and cultural – even in governmental behavior – China has completely conformed to the dictates of capital and the activities of the market. If we aspire to understand Chinese intelletual and cultural life in the last decade of the twentieth century, we must understand the above transformations and their corresponding social manifestations.</p>
<p>The end of the Cultural Revolution marked the end of a socialism characterized by perpetual revolution and the critique of capitalism. In 1978, the socialist reform movement that has lasted to this day began. On the level of ideology, the criticism of prior socialism forcused first on its idealistic system of public ownership and egalitarianism, both of which led to a decrease in efficiency, and second on the dictatorial methods that caused political damage to the whole country. At the same time as the evaluation and the historical summing-up were proceeding, China’s socialist reforms, with improved efficiency as their focus, were launched.</p>
<p>In addition, in the course of reform and opening up, China was gradually absorbed into the global capitalist  market. </p>
<p>These reforms have plainly advanced economic development and reshaped the preexisting social structure, but what they have abandoned is Mao’s idealistic modernization methods while continuing the goal of modernization. Different from prereform modernization, the most important chracteristics of the socialist reforms that China is now implementing are marketization in the economic arena and the convergence of the Chinese economy, society, and the culture with the contemporary capitalist system.</p>
<p>The astonishing achievements brought about in China by the contemporary socialist reforms are not limited to the economic arena, but also entail profound political implications.</p>
<p>The reconsideration of China’s problems by placing them in the context of globalization is an urgent theoretical problem. </p>
<p>The modern era, as a historical phase, continues. This provides the impetus for the continued existence and development of critical thought; it may prove for Chinese intellectuals to be a historic opportunity for theoretical and institutional innovation.</p>
