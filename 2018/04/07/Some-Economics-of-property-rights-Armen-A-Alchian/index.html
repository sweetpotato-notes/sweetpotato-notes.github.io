        <p>More directly, the forms and kinds of property rights sanctioned in a society define or identify the kinds of competition, discrimination or behavior characteristic of that society.</p>
<p>A property right for me means some protection against other people’s choosing against my will one of the uses of resources, said to mine.</p>
<p>If there were no costs of negotiating such exchanges of rights and policing them, the initial partitioning of rights would not affect the way resources are used. (by Ronald Coase)</p>
<p>The two derivative implications are:<br>(1) concentration of rewards and costs more directly on each person responsible for them, and<br>(2) comparative advantage effects of specialized applications of (a) knowledge in control and (b) of risk bearing.</p>
<p>But if people differ in any of these respects, as they in fact do, it can be shown that specialization in various tasks – including that of owning a business – will increase wealth.</p>
<p>Ownership ability includes attitude toward risk bearing, knowledge of different people’s productive abilities, foresight and, of course, judgement.</p>
<p>But public ownership practically eliminates possibilities of specialization among owners – though not of employees in the publicly owned venture.</p>
<p>We are not arguing that private property even in its purest form is perfect in the cost-bearing sense. No standard of perfection is available. All of our statements have been comparative in degrees of cost bearing.</p>
<p>The presence of one kind of relative deficiency does not justify a switch to another agency – which has other kinds of deficiencies.</p>
<p>As we suggested earlier, public and private ownership are used for different purposes, and in some cases because of these different behavioral implications.</p>
