        <p>A study of 2866 farms in seventeen localities and seven provinces in China （1925-1930）</p>
<p>The basis of Chinese agriculture is a farm system of unfenced scattered plots of land for the most part inherited, difficult of management from the farmsteads which are usually located in villages or hamlets of varying size. These villages and hamlets dot the landscape about as thickly as do the solitary farmsteads in the United States, and this signifies a dense population as well as a rural social system entirely different from that in most western countries.</p>
<p>The farm land is generally worked by owners, although approximately one-fifth is farmed by tenants and another one-fifth by part owners, the extent of tenancy varying from almost none to nearly one hundred per cent tenants in some localities. Systems of rent are quite similar to those found in other countries. Rental charges, however, are often not fair either for the tenant or the landlord and on the average rents should be reduced something over one-fifth the present amount.</p>
<p>Not only is the area of land worked by the farmer in China small, but he has also far smaller capital and equipment than the western farmer. In fact, his main investment is labor, but even this is not very great since the Chinese farm averages only two men giving full time to the farm business compared with approximately one and one-half men in the United States. The relatively small amount of labor used on the limited amount of land is partly because the farm business is not sufficiently enlarged by the use of more intensive methods of farming.</p>
<p>The production from the farm business in China and in the United States is remarkably equal in quantity per unit of land, although the method of obtaining these products are entirely different. In the United States the chief means has been the use of capital as well as labor; in China it has been by the use of labor, for the most part human labor, and with very little capital. The resulting production per unit of labor in the United States is apparently at least twenty-five fold greater than in China. Because of the dense population and the high cost of capital, it is evident, therefore, that the great natural resources of China is her man power. What she has to do is to learn how to make the most of this immense resource, because, on the whole, neither human nor animal labor is used to its full capacity.</p>
<p>The remedies for this too small size of farm business are difficult to find. Colonization seems scarcely the solution, since lands for such extensive colonization as would be needed are limited, even in Manchuria and Northwest. Moreover, unless something is done to check the growth of population, colonization will do little permanent good. The same may be said of drawing men from the land to industry. As China becomes modernized, it is inevitable that industries will develop and a certain number of the country people be absorbed into them. Yet it can scarcely be hoped that sufficient numbers of them will be so absorbed as to relieve the present agricultural situation very much. The best future solution of the problem seems to be in some method of population control, and the best immediate solution, more intensive methods of raising crops and the growing of crops that produce more food per unit of land. Such productivity, however, will also be useless if population continues to grow.</p>
<p>The farmer’s life, moreover, needs to be enriched mentally as well as materially. Few of the farmers of China have enough education to enable them to profit from reading, and since three-fourths of the children of farmers are not in school, there seems little chance for immediate improvement in this respect. The farmer cannot be blamed for this directly, since the type of old-fashioned classical school, which has been the only one for him to attend, has not been one to give him any practical help or inspiration. His life seems meagre in recreation, although that he is a social creature is shown by the regular, though small, items expended yearly for tea-drinking with friends, religious cults, and like activities.</p>
<p>China has been a country without reliable statistics, and it is to her advantage to obtain them, not only from the point of view of taking her place in world statistics, but also for the important reason of self-knowledge before there can be self-improvement. This study was begun with the idea of collecting accurate data on Chinese farming conditions to teach to Chinese college students, so that these students might in the future discover for themselves the facts of their own country.</p>
