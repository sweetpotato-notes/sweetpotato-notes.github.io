        <p>First, to clear the ground, a brief statement is given of a generally ignored aspect of ‘profit maximization,’ that is, where foresight is uncertain, ‘profit maximization’ is meaningless as a guide to specifiable action.</p>
<p>Adaptive, imitative, and trial-and-error behavior in the pursuit of ‘positive profits’ is utilized rather than its sharp contrast, the pursuit of ‘maximized profits’.</p>
<p>Uncertainty arises from at least two sources: imperfect foresight and human inability to solve complex problems containing a host of variables even when an optimum is definable.</p>
<p>The only way to make ‘profit maximization’ a specifically meaningful action is to postulate a model containing certainty.</p>
<p>This is the criterion by which the economic system selects survivors: those who realizes positive profits are the survivors; those who suffer losses disappear.</p>
<p>Also, the greater the uncertainties of the world, the greater is the possibility that profits would go to venturesome and lucky rather than to logical, careful, fact-gathering individuals.</p>
<p>Among all competitors, those whose particular conditions happen to be the most appropriate of those offered to the economic system for testing and adoption will be ‘selected’ as survivors.</p>
<p>A second element is the ability to adapt one’s self b various methods to an appropriate situation.</p>
<p>Less appropriately acting organisms of the same general class having lower probabilities of survival will find survival difficult.</p>
<p>For example, the long lives and disparate sizes of business firms and hereditary fortunes may seem to be reliable evidence of consistent foresighted motivation and nonrandom behavior.</p>
<p>Thus individual random behavior does not eliminate the likelihood of observing ‘appropriate’ decisions.</p>
<p>Even if environmental conditions cannot be forecast, the economist can compare for given alternative potential situations the types of behavior that would have higher probability of viability or adoption.</p>
<p>Empirical investigations via questionnaire methods, so far used, are incapable of evaluating the validity of marginal productivity analysis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, failure or success often reflects the willingness to depart from rules when conditions have changed; what counts, then, is not only imitative behavior but the willingness to abandon it at the ‘right’ time and cirmstances.</p>
<p>The economic counterparts of genetic heredity, mutations, and natural selection are imitation, innovation, and positive profits.</p>
<p>What really counts is the various actions actually tried, for it is from these that ‘success’ is selected, not from some set of perfect actions.</p>
<p>The formalization of this aproach awaits the marriage of the theory of stochastic processes and economics – two fields of thought admirably suited for union. </p>
<p>It is conjectured that the suggested modification is applicable to a wide class of events and is worth attempts at empirical verification. </p>
