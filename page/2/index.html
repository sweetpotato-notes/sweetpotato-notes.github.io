        <p> How do firms decide which transactions to carry out in-house and which to procure through the market? In response to this question, a large theoretical literature has developed. One branch of this literature-transaction cost economics-argues that integration may be a more efficient way to organize when contracts are incomplete and parties cannot easily switch trading partners (Oliver Williamson 1975, 1985).J Under these conditions, ex post renegotiation will be both necessary and costly and, as a result, the transaction costs of market exchange may be substantial.</p>
<p> This paper examines patterns of vertical integration in an industry in which transactions are complex, contracts are incomplete, and ex post adaptation occurs frequently. Our setting is the US regional airline industry. All of the large network airlines, often called “majors,” subcontract some of their flights to regional carriers. There is substantial heterogeneity both within and across majors in the extent to which these regional partners are owned. While majors and regionals write contracts that specify the schedule of flights that the regional is to operate, the complexity of airline operations prevents them from writing contracts that specify how that schedule would change as different contingencies arise. As a result, ex post adaptation decisions become necessary, resulting from factors such as adverse weather, mechanical problems, or air traffic control disruptions. However, majors and regionals will generally face conflicting incentives with respect to schedule adjustments. While majors seek to optimize the overall profitability of their network, regionals face financial incentives that are based only on the subset of routes that they serve. Thus, the costs of renegotiation with an independent regional may be large, possibly creating a role for ownership as a means to facilitate ex post adaptation.</p>
<p> Our empirical analysis shows that vertically integrated regionals are more likely to be used on routes between airports with more precipitation and, in particular, with more snowfall. In addition, we find that owned regional partners are more likely to be used on city pairs that have the major’s hub at least at one endpoint and on city pairs between airports at which the major operates a larger number of flights. One advantageous feature of our data is that several majors own some of their regional partners while also contracting with others. This allows us to include firm dummies and investigate the factors affecting the “make-or-buy” decision for a given firm. We find similar effects with and without airline dummies in the estimation, which suggests that our effects are identified by variation within firms as well as variation across firms.</p>
<p> This paper contributes to the literature that seeks to explain patterns of vertical integration within industries (see Francine Lafontaine and Margaret Slade 2007, for a review). Most significantly, we believe this study is the first to carry out a large-scale analysis of the relationship between integration and the costs of ex post adaptation using explicit measures of both the likelihood and costliness of adaptation decisions. The clear relationship between weather and flight disruptions provides us with a way to measure the probability of ex post adaptations in a precise and credible way. In addition, our setting allows us to investigate the relationship between vertical integration and underlying transaction characteristics, while controlling for unobservable factors that affect a particular firm’s relative returns from vertical integration. To our knowledge, this is one of the first papers outside of the franchising literature to examine this.</p>
<p> We have examined if the likelihood and costliness of ex post adaptation decisions affects firms’ incentives to vertically integrate. Our results indicate the existence of a strong empirical relationship. We have found that majors are more likely to use owned regionals on city pairs with adverse weather and on city pairs that are more highly integrated into their network. Importantly, we find qualitatively similar results when we restrict our sample to the set of majors that use both owned and independent regionals and include firm dummies in our regressions. We interpret our results as suggesting that ownership allows firms to reduce the transaction costs that arise when negotiations over ex post adaptation decisions become necessary.</p>
