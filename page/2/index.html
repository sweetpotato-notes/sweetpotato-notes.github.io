        <p>For our purpose, a very wide definition suggests itself, to wit: a science is any kind of knowledge that has been the object of conscious efforts to improve it. Such efforts produce habits of mind – methods or ‘techniques’ – and a command of facts unearthed by these techniques which are beyond the range of the mental habits and the factual knowledge of everyday life. Hence we may also adopt the practically equivalent definition: a science is any field of knowledge that has developed specialized techniques of fact-finding and of interpretation or inference (analysis). Finally, if we wish to emphasize sociological aspects, we may formulate still another definition, which is also practically equivalent to the other two: a science is any field of knowledge in which there are people, so-called research workers or scientists or scholars, who engage in the task of improving upon the existing stock of facts and methods and who, in the process of doing so, acquire a command of both that differentiates them from the ‘layman’ and eventually also from the mere ‘practitioner.’ Many other definitions would be just as good. Here are two which I add without further explanations: (1) science is refined common sense; (2) science is tooled knowledge.</p>
<p>There is however another and still more compelling reason. The exclusion of any kind of tooled knowledge would amount to declaring our own standards to be absolutely valid for all times and places. But this we cannot do. In practice we have indeed no choice but to interpret and to appraise every piece of tooled knowledge, past as well as present, in the light of our standards, since we have no others. They are the results of a development of more than six centuries, during which the realm of scientifically admissible procedures or techniques has been more and more restricted in the sense that more and more procedures or techniques have been ruled out as inadmissible. We mean this critically restricted realm only when we speak of ‘modern’ or ‘empirical’ or ‘positive’ science. Its rules of procedure differ in different departments of science and, as we have already seen above, are never beyond doubt. Broadly, however, they may be described by two salient characteristics: they reduce the facts we are invited to accept on scientific grounds to the narrower category of ‘facts verifiable by observation or experiment’; and they reduce the range of admissible methods to ‘logical inference from verifiable facts.’ Henceforth we shall put ourselves on this standpoint of empirical science, at least so far as its principles are recognized in economics. But in doing so we must bear this in mind: although we are going to interpret doctrines from this standpoint we do not claim any ‘absolute’ validity for it; and although, reasoning from this standpoint, we may describe any given propositions or methods as invalid – always of course with reference to the historical conditions in which they were formulated – we do not therefore exclude them from the realm of scientific differently, deny to them scientific character – which must be appraised, if at all, according to the ‘professional’ standards of every time and place.</p>
<p>Economic theory does something entirely different. It cannot indeed, any more than can theoretical physics, do without simplifying schemata or models that are intended to portrary certain aspects of reality and take some things for granted in order to establish others according to certain rules of procedure. So far as our present argument is concerned, the things (propositions) that we take for granted may be called indiscriminately either hypotheses or axioms or postulates or assumptions or even principles, and the things (propositions) that we think we have established by admissible procedure are called theorems. Of course a proposition may figure in one argement as a postulate and in another as a theorem. Now, hypotheses of this kind are also suggested by facts – they are framed with an eye to observations made – but in strict logic they are arbitrary creations of the analyst. They differ from the hypotheses of the first kind in that they do not embody final results of research that are supposed to be interesting for their own sake, but are were instruments or tools framed for the purpose of establishing interesting results. Moreover, framing them is no more all the economic theorist does than framing statistical hypotheses is all that the statistical theorist or in fact any theorist does. Just as important is the devising of the other gadgets by which results may be extracted from the hypotheses – all the concepts (such as ‘marginal rate of substitution,’ ‘marginal productivity,’multiplier,’’accelerator’), relations between concpets, and methods of handling these relations, all of which have nothing hypothetical about them. And it is the sum total of such gadgets – inclusive of strategically useful assumptions – which constitutes economic theory. In Mrs. Robinson’s unsurpassably felicitous phrase, economic theory is a box of tools.</p>
<p>For the rest we are particularly interested in logic and psychology. The former claims our attention because economists have made a not inconsiderable contribution to it but especially because of their propensity to dogmatize and to quarrel about ‘method’: economists who enjoy this sport are apt to be influenced by the writings of the logicians of their time which therefore, though more apparently than really, gain some influence, legitimate or otherwise, upon our work. As regards psychology, there is the view that came first to the fore in the eighteenth century, and hence has been sponsored intermittently, that economics like other social sciences deals with human behavior. Psychology is really the basis from which any social science must start and in terms of which all fundamental explanation must run. This view, which has been defended as strongly as it has been attacked, we shall denote by the term Psychologism. Actually, however, economists have never allowed their analysis to be influenced by the professional psychologists of their times, but have always framed for themselves such assumptions about psychical processes as they thought it desirable to make. On the one hand, we shall note this fact occasionally whith surprise because there exist problems in economic analysis that might be attacked with advantage by methods worked out by psychologists. On the other hand, we msut avoid a very natural delusion. If we use an assumption the contents of which seem to belong to a particular field, this does not necessarily mean that we actually invade that field. For instance, the so-called law of decreasing returns from land refers to what might be termed a physical fact. But, as has been pointed out already, this does not mean that in formulating this assumption we are entering the field of physics. Similarly, when I state the assumption that as I go on eating successive pieces of bread my desire for further such pieces decreases, I may be said to be stating a psychic fact. But, in doing so, I am not borrowing anything from professional psychology, good or bad; I am simply formulating what rightly or wrongly I believe to be a fact of common experience. If we place ourselves on this standpoint, we shall find that there is much less of psychology about economic propositions than one might think at first sight. To speak of psychological laws, such as the Keynesian law of the propensity to consume, is a flagrant abuse, because this practice suggest justification for our assumptions, which, in effect, do not exist. Nevertheless, it is necessary to glance ocasionally at the developments in the field of professional psychology, and this necessity arises, though less often, also with respect to a number of other sciences. For the moment, we confine ourselves to mentioning biology as an example. There is, or has been, such a thing as social and economic Darwinism. If we are to appraise this phenomenon, it is just as well to make sure of what Charles Darwin actually said and of the methods and meterials that induced him to say it.</p>
<p>There was no such thing as a New Spirit of Capitalism in the sense that people would have had to acquire a new way of thinking in order to be able to transform a feudal economic world into a wholly different capitalist one. So soon as we realize that pure Feudalism and pure Capitalism are equally unrealistic creations of our own mind, the problem of what it was that turned the one into the other vanishes completely. The society of the feudal ages contained all the germs of the society of the capitalist age. These germs developed by slow degrees, each step teaching its lesson and producing another increment of capitalist methods and of capitalist ‘spirit.’ Similarly, there was no such thing as a New Spirit of Free Inquiry whose emergence would call for explanation. The scholastic science of the Middle Ages contained all the germs of the laical science of the Renaissance. And these germs developed slowly but steadily within the system of scholastic thought so that the laics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries continued rather than destroyed scholastic work. This applies even where it is most persistently denied. </p>
