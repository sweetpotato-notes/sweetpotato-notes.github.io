        <p>In this we differ quite a bit from other sciences (including observational ones rather than experimental) such as archeology, astrophysics, biology, or even psychology where the ‘facts’ tend to be recorded by the professionals themselves, or by others who have been trained by and are supervised by those who will be doing the final data analysis.</p>
<p>It is only relatively recently, with the initiation of the negative income tax experiments and various longitudinal surveys intended to follow up the effects of different governmental programs, that econometric professionals had actually become involved in the primary data collection process. Once attempted, the job turned out to be much more difficult than was thought originally, and taught us some humility. Even with relatively large budgets, it was not easy to figure out how to ask the right question and to collect relevant answers. In part this is because the world is much more complicated than even some of our more elaborate models allow for, and partly also because economists tend to formulate their theories in non-testable terms, using variables for which it is hard to find empirical counterparts. For example, even with a large budget, it is difficult to think of the right series of questions, answers to which would yield an unequivocal number of the level for “human capital” or “permanent income” of an individual. Thinking about such ‘alibi-removing’ questions should make us a bit more humble, restrain our continuing attacks on the various official data producing agencies, and push us towards formulating theories with more regard to what is observable and what kind of data may be available.</p>
<p>There are at least three interrelated and overlapping causes of our difficulties: (1) the theory (model) is incomplete or incorrect; (2) the units are wrong, either at too high a level of aggregation or with no way of allowing for the heterogeneity of responses; and, (3) the data are inaccurate on their own terms, incorrect relative to what they purport to measure. The average applied study has to struggle with all three possibilities.</p>
<p>At the macro level and even in the usual industry level study, it is common to assume away the underlying heterogeneity of the individual actors and analyze the data within the framework of the “representative” firm or “average” individual, ignoring the aggregation difficulties associated with such concepts. In analyzing microdata, it is much more difficult to evade this issue and hence much attention is paid to various individual “effects” and “heterogeneity” issues. This is wherein the promise of longitudinal data lies - their ability to control and allow for additive individual effects. On the other hand, as is the case in most other aspects of economics, there is no such thing as a free lunch: going down to the individual level exacerbates both some of the left out variables problems and the importance of errors in measurement. Variables such as age, land quality, or the occupational structure of an enterprise, are much less variable in the aggregate. Ignoring them at the micro level can be quite costly, however. Similarly, measurement errors which tend to cancel out when averaged over thousands or even millions of respondents, loom much larger when the individual is the unit of analysis.</p>
<p>It is possible, of course, to take an alternative view: that there are no data problems only model problems in econometrics. For any set of data there is the “right” model. Much of econometrics is devoted to procedures which try to assess whether a particular model is “right” in this sense and to criteria for deciding when a particular model fits and is “correct enough” (see Chapter 5, Hendry, 1983 and the literature cited there). Theorists and model builders often proceed, however, on the assumption that ideal data will be available and define variables which are unlikely to be observable, at least not in their pure form. Nor do they specify in adequate detail the connection between the actual numbers and their theoretical counterparts. Hence, when a contradiction arises it is then possible to argue “so much worse for the facts.” In practice one cannot expect theories to be specified to the last detail nor the data to be perfect or of the same quality in different contexts. Thus any serious data analysis has to consider at least two data generation components: the economic behavior model describing the stimulus response behavior of the economic actors and the measurement model, describing how and when this behavior was recorded and summarized. While it is usual to focus our attention on the former, a complete analysis must consider them both.</p>
<p>It is possible to classify economic data along several different dimensions: (a) Substantive: Prices, Quantities, Commodity Statistics, Population Statistics, Banking Statistics, etc.; (b) Objective versus Subjective: Prices versus expectations about them, actual wages versus self reported opinions about well being; (c) Type and periodicity: Time series versus cross-sections; monthly, quarterly, or annual; (d) Level of aggregation: Individuals, families, or firms (micro), and districts, states, industries, sectors, or whole countries (macro); (e) Level of fabrication: primary, secondary, or tertiary; (f) Quality: Extent, reliability and validity. </p>
<p>Most of our data are not of this sort, however. They have usually already undergone several levels of processing or fabrication.</p>
<p>I do not want to imply that the aggregate numbers are in some sense worse than the primary ones. Often they are better. Errors may be reduced by aggregation and the informal and formal smoothing procedures may be based on correct prior information and result in a more reliable final result. What needs to be remembered is that the final published results can be affected by the properties of the data generating mechanism, by the procedures used to collect and process the data. For example, some of the time series properties of the major published economic series may be the consequence of the smoothing techniques used in their construction rather than a reflection of the underlying economic reality. (This was brought forceably home to me many years ago while collecting unpublished data on the diffusion of hybrid corn at the USDA when I came across a circular instructing the state agricultural statisticians: “When in doubt -use a growth curve.“) Some series may fluctuate because of fluctuations in the data generating institutions themselves. For example, the total number of patents granted by the U.S. Patent Office in a particular year depends rather strongly on the total number of patent examiners available to do the job. For budgetary and other reasons, their number has gone through several cycles, inducing concomitant cycles in the actual number of patents granted. This last example brings up the point that while particular numbers may be indeed correct as far as they go, they do not really mean what we thought they did.</p>
<p>Such considerations lead one to consider the rather amorphous notion of data “quality.” Ultimately, quality cannot be defined independently of the intended use of the particular data set. In practice, however, data are used for multiple purposes and thus it makes some sense to indicate some general notions of data quality. Earlier I listed extent, reliability, and validity as the three major dimensions along which one may judge the quality of different data sets. Extent is a synonym for richness: How many variables are present, what interesting questions had been asked, how many years and how many firms or individuals were covered? Reliability is actually a technical term in psychometrics, reflecting the notion of replicability and measuring the relative amount of random measurement error in the data by the correlation coefficient between replicated or related measurement of the same phenomenon. Note that a measurement may be highly reliable in the sense that it is a very good measure of whatever it measures, but still be the wrong measure for our particular purposes.</p>
<p>This brings us to the notion of validity which can be subdivided in turn into representativeness and relevance. I shall come back to the issue of how representative<br>is a body of data when we discuss issues of missing and incomplete data. It will suffice to note here that it contains the technical notion of coverage: Did all units in the relevant universe have the same (or alternatively, different but known and adjusted for) probability of being selected into the sample that underlies this particular data set? Coverage and relevance are related concepts which shade over into issues that arise from the use of “proxy” variables in econometrics. The validity and relevance questions relate less to the issue of whether a particular measure is a good (unbiased) estimate of the associated population parameter and more to whether it actually corresponds to the conceptual variable of interest. Thus one may have a good measure of current prices which are still a rather poor indicator of the currently expected future price and relatively extensive and well measured IQ test scores which may still be a poor measure of the kind of “ability” that is rewarded in the labor market. </p>
<p>At the national income accounts level there are serious definitional problems about the borders of economic activity (e.g. home production and the investment value of children) and the distinction between final and intermediate consumption activity (e.g. what fraction of education and health expenditures can be thought of as final rather than intermediate “goods” or “ bads”). There are also difficult measurement problems associated with the existence of the underground economy and poor coverage of some of the major service sectors. The major serious problem from the econometric point of view probably occurs in the measurement of “real” output, GNP or industry output in “constant prices,” and the associated growth measures. Since most of the output measures are derived by dividing (“deflating”) current value totals by some price index, the quality of these measures is intimately connected to the quality of the available price data. Because of this, it is impossible to treat errors of measurement at the aggregate level as being independent across price and “quantity” measures.</p>
<p>The available price data, even when they are a good indicator of what they purport to measure, may still be inadequate for the task of deflation. For productivity comparisons and for production function estimation the observed prices are supposed to reflect the relevant marginal costs and revenues in a, at least temporary, competitive equilibrium. But this is unlikely to be the case in sectors where output or prices are controlled, regulated, subsidized, and sold under various multi-part tariffs. Because the price data are usually based on the pricing of a few selected items in particular markets, they may not correspond well to the average realized price for the industry as a whole during a particular time period, both because “easily priced” items may not be representative of the average price movements in the industry as a whole and because many transactions are made with a lag, based on long term contracts. There are also problems associated with getting accurate transactions prices (Kruskal and Telser, 1960 and Stigler and Kindahl, 1970) but the major difficulty arises from getting comparable prices over time, from the continued change in the available set of commodities, the “quality change” problem.</p>
<p>“Quality change” is actually a special version of the more general comparability problem, the possibility that similarly named items are not really similar, either across time or individuals. In many cases the source of similarly sounding items is quite different: Employment data may be collected from plants (establishments), companies, or households. In each case the answer to the same question may have a different meaning. Unemployment data may be reported by a teenager directly or by his mother, whose views about it may both differ and be wrong. The wording of the question defining unemployment may have changed over time and so should also the interpretation of the reported statistic. The context in which a question is asked, its position within a series of questions on a survey, and the willingness to answer some of the questions may all be changing over time making it difficult to maintain the assumption that the reported numbers in fact relate to the same underlying phenomenon over time or across individuals and cultures. </p>
<p>The common notion of quality change relates to the fact that many commodities are changing over time and that often it is impossible to construct appropriate<br>pricing comparisons because the same varieties are not available at different times and in different places. Conceptually one might be able to get around this problem by assuming that the many different varieties of a commodity differ only along a smaller number of relevant dimensions (characteristics, specifications), estimate the price-characteristics relationship econometrically and use the resulting estimates to impute a price to the missing model or variety in the relevant comparison period. This approach, pioneered by Waugh (1928) and Court (1936) and revived by Griliches (1961) has become known as the “hedonic” approach to price measurement. The data requirements for the application of this type of an approach are quite severe and there are very few official price indexes which incorporate it into their construction procedures. Actually, it has been used much more widely in labor economics and in the analyses of real estate values than in the construction of price deflator indexes. See Griliches (1971) Gordon (1983), Rosen (1974) and Triplett (1975) for expositions, discussions, and examples of this approach to price measurement.</p>
<p>The issues discussed above affect also the construction and use of various “capital” measures in production function studies and productivity growth analyses. Besides the usual aggregation issues connected with the “existence” of an unambiguous capital concept (see Diewert, 1980 and Fisher, 1969 on this) the available measures suffer from potential quality change problems, since they are usually based on some cumulated function of past investment expenditures deflated by some combination of available price indexes. In addition, they are also based on rather arbitrary assumptions about the pattern of survival of machines over time and the time pattern of deterioration in the flow of their services. The available information on the reasonableness of such assumptions is very sparse, ancient, and flimsy. In some contexts it is possible to estimate the appropriate pattern from the data rather than impose them a priori. </p>
<p>Similar issues arise also in the measurement of labor inputs and associated variables at both the macro and micro levels. At the macro level the questions<br>revolve about the appropriate weighting to be given to different types of labor: young-old, male-female, black-white, educated vs. uneducated, and so forth.<br>The direct answer here as elsewhere is that they should be weighted by their appropriate marginal prices but whether the observed prices actually reflect<br>correctly the underlying differences in their respective marginal productivities is one of the more hotly debated topics in labor economics. (See Griliches, 1970 on<br>the education distinction and Medoff and Abraham, 1980 on the age distinction.) </p>
<p>Rather, the point is that one cannot take a particular published price index series and interpret it as measuring adequately the underlying notion of a price change for a well specified, unchanging, commodity or service being transacted under identical conditions and terms in different time periods.</p>
<p>One needs to reiterate, that in these kinds of models (as is also true for the rest of econometrics) the consistency of the final estimates depends both on the correctness of the assumed economic model and the correctness of the assumptions about the error structure. lo We tend to focus here on the latter, but the former is probably more important. For example, in Friedman’s (1957) classical permanent income consumption function model, the estimated elasticity of consumption with respect to income is a direct estimate of one minus the error ratio (the ratio of the variance of transitory income to the variance of measured income). But this conclusion is conditional on having assumed that the true elasticity of consumption with respect to permanent income is unity. If that is wrong, the first conclusion does not follow. Similarly in the profit-capital stock example above, we can do something because we have assumed that the true depreciation is both known and geometric. All our conclusions about the amount of error in the investment series are conditional on the correctness of these assumptions. </p>
<p>The major problem in econometrics is not just missing data but the possibility (or more accurately, probability) that they are missing for a variety of self-selection reasons. Such “behavioral missing” implies not only a loss of efficiency but also the possibility of serious bias in the estimated coefficients of models that do not take this into account. The recent revival of interest in econometrics in limited dependent variables models, sample-selection, and sample self-selection problems has provided both the theory and computational techniques for attacking this problem. Since this range of topics is taken up in Chapter 28, I will only allude to some of these issues as we go along. It is worth noting, however, that this area has been pioneered by econometricians (especially Amemiya and Heckman) with statisticians only recently beginning to follow in their footsteps (e.g. Little, 1983).</p>
