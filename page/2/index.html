            <p>In the closing decades of the twentieth century, China defied the best predictions of development economists and Sinologists alike in compiling a stunning record of economic growth. This was accomplished in the face of formidable obstacles including inefficient state enterprises, ambiguous property rights, irrational prices, primitive transportation, and outmoded banking and securities facilities. </p>
<p>In sum, reforms generated both from above and from below have brought far-reaching, even cataclysmic, changes to the economy, society, politics and culture, changes that touch every citizen and extend to every corner of the land and beyond to redefine China’s place in the world.</p>
<p>It is commonly asserted that, despite far-reaching economic and social reform, China’s political system remains frozen.</p>
<p>Despite significant changes, an apparent disjuncture remains between the free-wheeling economic expansion, on the one hand, and the still highly circumscribed political climate, on the other.</p>
<p>The upsurge in such activities is attributable to several factors attendant upon the reforms: increased population mobility, high levels of surplus labour and unemploymen, growing income disparities, access to previously unavailable economic resources, and declining civic values.</p>
<p>The problem with the diverse theories sketched briefly above is that, while suggestive for analysing the psychological and material roots of protests, resistance, rebellion and revolution, none specifies the threshold point at which popular aspirations and grievances gain sufficient momentum to become politically threatening. Thus, however useful the theories may be in offering explanations for what occurred after the fact, and in drawing attention to areas of conflict and potential resistance, they offer little predictive value.</p>
<p>China’s extensive and deepening integration into the international system in general, and its various commitments to international laws and institutions in particular, have placed leaders under new constraints and provided dissidents with new sources of moral support.</p>
<p>Both liberty and equality are among the primary goals pursued by human beings throughout many centuries; but total liberty for wolves is death to the lambs, total liberty of the powerful, the gifted, is not compatible with the rights to a decent existence of the weak and the less gifted… Equality may demand the restraint of the liberty of those who wish to dominate; liberty - without some modicum of which there is not choice and therefore no possibility of remaining human as we understand the word - may have to be curtailed in order to make room for social welfare, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, to leave room for the liberty of others, to allow justice or fairness to be exercised.</p>
<p>Neo-liberal economists cautioned that an economy based on state ownership of the means of production could not sustain long-term, stable growth. In their view, privatization is a conditio sine qua non for the market economy This premise, enshrined in the ‘Washington Consensus’ became the guiding principle for many of the social engineering programmes of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the former Soviet Union and the East-bloc countries.</p>
<p>Women’s employment must be linked with women’s liberation. Economics is the foundation. Without participation in social production, women would have no economic status. This would in turn undermine the equality between men and women in politics, society and family.</p>

            <p>A study of 2866 farms in seventeen localities and seven provinces in China （1925-1930）</p>
<p>The basis of Chinese agriculture is a farm system of unfenced scattered plots of land for the most part inherited, difficult of management from the farmsteads which are usually located in villages or hamlets of varying size. These villages and hamlets dot the landscape about as thickly as do the solitary farmsteads in the United States, and this signifies a dense population as well as a rural social system entirely different from that in most western countries.</p>
<p>The farm land is generally worked by owners, although approximately one-fifth is farmed by tenants and another one-fifth by part owners, the extent of tenancy varying from almost none to nearly one hundred per cent tenants in some localities. Systems of rent are quite similar to those found in other countries. Rental charges, however, are often not fair either for the tenant or the landlord and on the average rents should be reduced something over one-fifth the present amount.</p>
<p>Not only is the area of land worked by the farmer in China small, but he has also far smaller capital and equipment than the western farmer. In fact, his main investment is labor, but even this is not very great since the Chinese farm averages only two men giving full time to the farm business compared with approximately one and one-half men in the United States. The relatively small amount of labor used on the limited amount of land is partly because the farm business is not sufficiently enlarged by the use of more intensive methods of farming.</p>
<p>The production from the farm business in China and in the United States is remarkably equal in quantity per unit of land, although the method of obtaining these products are entirely different. In the United States the chief means has been the use of capital as well as labor; in China it has been by the use of labor, for the most part human labor, and with very little capital. The resulting production per unit of labor in the United States is apparently at least twenty-five fold greater than in China. Because of the dense population and the high cost of capital, it is evident, therefore, that the great natural resources of China is her man power. What she has to do is to learn how to make the most of this immense resource, because, on the whole, neither human nor animal labor is used to its full capacity.</p>
<p>The remedies for this too small size of farm business are difficult to find. Colonization seems scarcely the solution, since lands for such extensive colonization as would be needed are limited, even in Manchuria and Northwest. Moreover, unless something is done to check the growth of population, colonization will do little permanent good. The same may be said of drawing men from the land to industry. As China becomes modernized, it is inevitable that industries will develop and a certain number of the country people be absorbed into them. Yet it can scarcely be hoped that sufficient numbers of them will be so absorbed as to relieve the present agricultural situation very much. The best future solution of the problem seems to be in some method of population control, and the best immediate solution, more intensive methods of raising crops and the growing of crops that produce more food per unit of land. Such productivity, however, will also be useless if population continues to grow.</p>
<p>The farmer’s life, moreover, needs to be enriched mentally as well as materially. Few of the farmers of China have enough education to enable them to profit from reading, and since three-fourths of the children of farmers are not in school, there seems little chance for immediate improvement in this respect. The farmer cannot be blamed for this directly, since the type of old-fashioned classical school, which has been the only one for him to attend, has not been one to give him any practical help or inspiration. His life seems meagre in recreation, although that he is a social creature is shown by the regular, though small, items expended yearly for tea-drinking with friends, religious cults, and like activities.</p>
<p>China has been a country without reliable statistics, and it is to her advantage to obtain them, not only from the point of view of taking her place in world statistics, but also for the important reason of self-knowledge before there can be self-improvement. This study was begun with the idea of collecting accurate data on Chinese farming conditions to teach to Chinese college students, so that these students might in the future discover for themselves the facts of their own country.</p>

            <p>Instead of making adjustments to the official aggregate data on investment, as other studies have done, we have used the commodity flow method. Estimates have been made for five investment components:<br>1) construction and installation,<br>2) domestic production of machinery and equipment,<br>3) imports of machinery and equipment,<br>4) office furniture and tools,<br>5) and other rural investment.<br>The five components have then been combined to form the estimates of total fixed investment. But in using this method we have been able to cover not only the investment made by the government within the state plan of basic construction but also the investment made by private concerns and households outside the state plan. The commodity flow method has also permitted us to adopt a new valuation basis.<br>The biases in the official valuation stemmed from two main sources: the underpayment of work brigades (draft labor) and the peculiar exchange rates used for computing the official values of imported goods. These biased have been removed in our estimates.</p>
<p>Our estimates generally confirm the government’s claim of investment acceleration in 1952-57. The average annual rate of fixed capital investment, that is, the proportion of GDP devoted to fixed capital formation, was 17.8 per cent in that period. This is remarkably higher than the estimated average rate of 7.5 per cent for 1931-36. If the comparison is made in terms of net capital formation, the difference between the two periods would be even wider. However, the years 1952-57 were followed by a period of tremendous fluctuations in fixed capital investment. Although there are no national income statistics, official or otherwise, which can be used to compute the exact rates of investment, we can say that the rates must have fallen to very low levels in 1961-64.</p>
<p>As in many underdeveloped countries, the speed of capital formation in prewar China was decisively constrained by the low level of voluntary saving in the private sector. In addition to the low level of income, the extremely low life expectancy gave rise to an age structure of the population unfavorable to saving efforts. An extraordinarily large proportion of people were under the working age. Both the birth rate and the infant mortality rate were high, so that a considerable amount of economic surplus in society had to be wasted on raising children who never grew old enough to participate in productive work.</p>
<p>So far as capital formation is concerned, the main change in the 1950’s occurred in the saving mechanism. Instead of relying on voluntary savings, the new government mobilized compulsory savings for the purpose of investment. The traditional constraint on saving was greatly relaxed thereby. In this way, the system of socialist planning can potentially serve as a shortcut to industrialization for underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p> The compulsory savings were realized in two major forms. First, through controls over wages and over prices of consumer goods, and the procurement programs and taxation in the rural areas, the government was able to restrain the consumption level and create budgetary surpluses. Those budgetary surpluses were tailored to, and would be used for, state investment. This is clearly shown by the chief role played by basic construction investment of the government in total capital formation throughout the Communist period.<br>The second form of compulsory saving was the direct use of surplus labor in rural areas for capital construction, such as road building and large water conservation projects. Although labor conscription is not unique in China, the scale which the Peking government used it during 1956-59 was certainly unprecedented. This scale would have been impossible had China not been socialized and the rural population not been regimented.</p>
<p>The steadily rising rate of investment in 1952-56 reflected the changed saving mechanism and the new investment drive of the Communist government; it was not the accidental burst of investment that is occasionally observed in a market economy. China really attempted to cut short the industrilization process by socializing the economy. However, compulsory savings in a socialist country are not without limitation. One of the serious problems is the contradiction between work incentives and a high rate of accumulation. As this study has shown, the economic policy of the Peking government entailed a high marginal propensity to invest. If over a long period most of the fruits of capital formation are devoted to further investment, sparing very little for improving living standards, the working masses might feel disappointed. This in fact was a major issue discussed by economists and planners in China in 1956-57. The consensus was that, while the pre-1956 rate of investment was correct, the rate in 1956 might be regarded as excessive. This review of investment policy led to the moderation in 1957.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the cautious opinions were silenced by Mao Tse-tung, who believes that revolutionary zeal can effectively overcome physical or material constraints. The second Five-Year Plan, carefully formulated by planners and formally approved by the National Congress, was torn up by Mao as sonn as it was made public. In its place came Mao’s Great Leap Forward movement. The fanatic investment and production drives nearly disintegrated the economy. The policy reversal adopted by the new leadership in the early 1960’s was meant to salvage the collapsing economy. One of the most urgent tasks was then to shift the emphasis from investment to consumption, so that work incentives could be restored.</p>
<p>What happened in China during the early 1960’s must be considered abnormal. It is only in very broad terms that one can connect the ups and downs in investment in the Communist era in a ‘functional’ way. That is, in such a political system there is no way to avoid extremist leaders. Consequently, extremist economic policies may occur from time to time, and policy reversals are required (i.e., functionally related) to redress the biases or heal the wounds.</p>
<p>Another crucial question is: What role did capital formation play in China’s economic growth during the Communist period? Interestingly, Western economists have traveled a full circle in their analyses of the function played by investment in an economy. The early Keynesian model, which focused on the problem of short-run stability in an economy, treated investment as a component of effective aggregate demand. This demand component was so volatile in a market economy that its fluctuation tended to cause depressions or inflations if it was not offset by a proper compensatory policy of the government. This view was later modified by E. D. Domar, who emphasized the double role of investment – as a demand component and as a capacity-creating factor on the supply side; from the new thesis came the famous Harrod-Domar model of economic growth. Thereafter, investment became virtually the most important element in all growth models developed by other economist. The importance of investment rested on its capacity-creating nature.</p>
<p>Another sharp turning point in the investment and growth theories came when R. M. Solow bulit his neoclassical model of economic growth. It is called neoclassical model because it assumes that full employment prevails all the time. Hence the function of investment as a demand component is completely ignored. The remaining question is then: How important is the other role played by investment – capacity-creating – in economic growth? According to Solow’s original calculation based on American historical data, the contribution of investment to economic growth was far less important than that of technological advancement. His results showed that 87 per cent of the increase in output per unit of labor input came from technological progresses and only 13 per cent stemmed from the expansion of capital stock.</p>
<p>One criticism of Solow’s initial model was that the measured contribution of technological changes is really a residual which reflects the working of all economic forces other than the inputs of labor and capital. Moreover, the importance of investment is understated because the model assumes that all technological changes have been the disemdodied type. Yet in reality the majority of innovations have to be embodied in new machines and equipment; the gains from those innovations cannot be realized unless firms make investments. This last point led Solow to develop his vintage model of economic growth, in which the embodiment effect of investment is taken into consideration. However, even in the vintage model and many other works which have subsequently appeared to refine Solow’s theory, the contribution of investment to economic growth is still overshadowed by other factors.</p>
<p>In a sense, in economic theory the importance of investment has shifted back from its connection with long-run economic growth to the connection with short-run economic stability. In other words, investment is important primarily because it is such a vital component in aggregate demand. In an affluent society, investment must take place at a high rate if effective demand is to be maintained at full employment. Otherwise a depression would set in.</p>
<p>In China investment has played a more important role than any that has been envisioned by the above models. Its importance, however, does not lie on the demand side. As a rule, there is no worry about demand deficiency in underdeveloped countries, since the propensity to save is low and there are adequate investment outlets. In fact, many of those countries are under constant pressure from inflation simply because domestic aggregate supply falls short of aggregate demand. In the case of Communist China, the situation is further simplified because the government has full control of saving, consumption, and investment.</p>
<p>The crucial role of investment is on the supply side. But even there the Solow model of economic growth does not apply fully. In view of the enormous gap in technology between China and industrially advanced countries, the proportion of technical changes that are of the embodied type must be greater in China than in the United States. Similarly, the quality difference of capital goods between two successive vintage points must be much wider in China than Solow’s model has postulated.</p>
<p>More important is the fact that Solow’s neoclassical assumption of full employment does not hold in China at all. China is perhaps the country with the largest surplus population, that is, persons whose marginal productivity falls below the minimum subsistence cost. In prewar China, capitalist firms hired workers up to the point at which their marginal productivity was equal to the subsistence wage. Thus, the bulk of surplus labor existed in the rural communities, where peasants, whether landowners or tenants, shared their incomes among family members. The situation has not drastically changed in the Communist era, since even state enterprises are unlikely to hire workers at a cost much higher than their contributions to production.</p>
<p>The marginal productivity of surplus labor is so low because the existing stock of capital goods is not sufficient to match the labor force. Only investment can provide extra employment opportunities in the urban areas and absorb unused labor productively in the rural areas. Therefore, in a backward country, both the technological changes and the absorption of surplus labor into production require new investment for embodiment. Where the amount of surplus labor is exceedingly large, as it is in China, the absorption of unused labor outweighs the embodiment of technological changes as the primary source of economic growth. In other words, output is increased at a higher speed by putting the unused labor in production rather than by raising the productivity of those who are already employed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the embodiment of technical changes and the absorption of unused labor. The new machines and production techniques developed by the advanced countries, including the Soviet Union, tend to be labor-saving, because their economies are characterized by labor shortages. Direct borrowing of modern technology from those countries without any adaptation would provide a minimum opportunity for new employment per unit of investment funds. This conflict is clearly demonstrated by the Chinese experience in their First Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>More than 80 per cent of the investment within the state plan in the First Five-Year Plan period went to heavy industry. It is estimated that investment in large plants accounted for over 60 percent of the planned total investment in industry. Ordinarily those large modern plants would require a relatively small amount of labor inputs per unit of fixed capital. In September 1956, when Chou En-lai announced the final version of the First Five-Year Plan, he anticipated that the industrial enterprises newly constructed or reconstructed during 1953-57 would contribute 15 per cent to the gross industrial value product for that period. By the end of 1957, however, it turned out that those new enterprises had actually contributed about 30 per cent to the gross value product. This increase was made possible through some adaptations to intensify the use of labor, such as the larger number of shifts of workers to assure a twenty-four-hour operation of machinery and equipment.</p>
<p>The investment policy adopted by the new leadership during 1961-65 was essentially a middle road, so far as the technological choice is concerned. It attempted to avoid the extreme in either direction. Although emphasis continued to be given to small-scale plants, those units were required to meet certain efficiency standards. Only under these circumstances could capital formation be expected to make its maximum contribution to economic growth.</p>
<p>We may conclude from our study that the Chinese experience has clearly demonstrated both the merits and demerits of the Communist approach to capital formation. On the credit side, a planned economy with all means of production controlled by the government can easily break some of the formidable barriers to economic growth that are generally encountered by underdeveloped countries. On the debit side, such an economy has no automatic mechanism which can effectively prevent economic policy in general and investement policy in particular from going to the extremes. The resulting series of adjustments and counter adjustments are a highly costly process.</p>

            <p>The transformation of the economy of the People’s Republic of China from a planned to a more market-oriented economy is one of the most significant developments in the world history during the last quarter of the 20th century.</p>
<p>A market economy differs from a centrally planned one in three important ways.<br>Major economic resources are privately owned rather than owned by the state.<br>Prices are determined by the market forces of demand and supply rather than by administrative orders.<br>Economic decisions concerning consumption, production, distribution, and investment are decentralized, being made by private citizens or individual enterprises rather than by central command.</p>
<p>A major objective of central procurement of agricultural products was to provide adequate supplies of essential food products to the urban residents under a system of rationing; among items rationed were food grain, vegetable oil, meat, sugar, and cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Since enterprises obtained their inputs through central allotment, surrended their outputs for central distribution, and had no control over their profits, they did not respond to prices. The main concern of enterprise managers was to obtain through skillful negotiations more than sufficient material and labor inputs to fulfill the production targets. They tended to understate the productive capacity of their enterprise in order to reduce output targets, and to overstate the input requirements in order to ensure their fulfillment. Inefficiencies and wastes occurred under this system, as partly reflected in the underutilization of prodcutive capacity and the large stockpiling of inventories in Chinese state enterprises (Zhou, 1982).</p>
<p>This ‘responsibility system’ is similar to private farming in a market economy, with each farm household leasing its land and paying the delivery quota as rent.</p>
<p>The major elements of the industrial reforms include<br>(i) a certain autonomy regarding the use of retained profits, production planning, sales of output, experimentation with new products, and capital expansion;<br>(ii) adoption of features of an ‘economic responsibility system’ by assignment of identifiable tasks to lower level units and payment to them according to productivity;<br>(iii) increase in the role of markets<br>(iv) the streamlining of the administrative system at local levels for enterprises under local control;<br>(v) the encouragement of the establishment of collectively owned enterprises.</p>
<p>Reform in the industrial sector has turned out to be more difficult than in the agricultural sector. It is much easier to make small farm householders behave like private enterprises in a market economy than to make large state enterprises so behave for four types of reasons.<br>First, ideologically, members of the Communist Party of China believe in the ownership and the control of the means of production by the state. They are unwilling to surrender control of large state enterprises to nongovernment individuals and allow them to keep substanial profits for themselves, as in the case of small farms.<br>Second, politically, government bureaucrats are unwilling to give up their power and vested interests by allowing the state enterprises to operate independently. Economic ministries tend to hold on to their control over the operations of the state enterprises. The bureau of material supplies tends to retain its control over the distribution of major material inputs.<br>Third, economically, large industrial enterprises are more dependent on factors outside their control than are the small household farms. Given a piece of land, a farm household can produce as it pleases, subject to climate conditions. A large industrial enterprise needs the supplies of equipment and of material inputs produced by other enterprises. The entire system of pricing and distribution of industrial products and material inputs has to be changed to provide more autonomy to the state enterprises.<br>Fourth, administratively, the efficient operation of a large industrial enterprise is much more difficult than operation of a small farm. Chinese managers often do not have sufficient knowledge and experience to run a modern enterprise as an independent entity. Even with additional training, managers and administrators of state enterprises are reluctant to give up their old habits of dependence on the economic ministries.<br>The mode of operation of a large economic organiation is difficult to change, as it is true for a large American corporation and more so for a large country like China.</p>
<p>Seven key elements of the Decision of 20 Oct 1984 concerning reform of the economic system are to<br>(i) give individual state enterprises autonomy in decisions regarding production, supply, marketing, pricing, investment, and personnel as independent profit-seeking economic units;<br>(ii) reduce the scope of central planning and, except for certain major products, change the method from mandatory planning to guidance planning;<br>(iii) allow prices of more products to be determined by the forces of demand and supply rather than by central control;<br>(iv) develop macroeconomic control mechanisms through the use of taxes, interest rates, and monetary policy under an improved financial and banking system;<br>(v) establish various forms of economic responsibility systems within individual enterprises to promote efficiency and encourage differential wage rates to compensate for different kinds of work and levels of productivity;<br>(vi) foster the development of individual and collective enterprises as supplements to the state enterprises;<br>(vii) expand foreign trade and investment as well as technological exchanges.<br>An often-quoted slogan to capture the essential characteristics of the reform is, ‘Invigorate the microeconomic units. Control by macroeconomic means.’</p>
<p>Reform toward a more market-oriented economy will continue in China. The degree of success may be uncertain, but there is no turning back to a system of central control in agriculture and in industry operating within closed doors. Substantial economic growth will continue even if structural reforms progress slowly. The Chinese economy was able to grow between 1952 to 1979 in spite of the adverse conditions of inefficient central planning and two very serious political disturbances. It can only be expected to grow faster under the more favorable economic and political conditions of the 1980s.</p>
<p>The first common feature in the growth process of both parts of China is the reduction of govenment intervention and the encouragement of private initiative.<br>Economic liberalization took place in Taiwan through government encouragement of private investment in the form of providing financial services of government banks, the establishment of a stock market, tax exemptions for certain industries, relaxing controls over the establishment of factories, and appropriately adjusting the prices of government-produced commodites and services.</p>
<p>The second common element is the important of the agricultural sector in the early stage of the growth process.<br>In both Taiwan and the Mainland, the  increase in agricultural productivity was achieved mainly by redistributing land to the farmers.</p>
<p>A third common feature is the promotion of exports as an important component of the development strategy.</p>
<p>The fourth element is the government’s emphasis on the stability of the general price level. The governments of both regions learned from the bitter experience of hyperinflation is China prior to the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, as inflation was recognized to be an important factor contributing to the collapse of the government of the Republic of China in the Mainland.<br>Two-digit inflation in the Mainland took place in 1988 because of the failure of the government to control the supply of money and credits, but price stability was restored by early 1990 mainly by contractionary monetary policy.</p>
<p>The fifth common element is the gradual decontrol of restrictions on imports and the setting of an official exchange rate close to the free market level.</p>
<p>Together with the rapid growth of the economy in the Mainland since 1977 was a transformation of the economy to a mostly private economy in the sense that by 1990 a large fraction of the national output was produced by profit-seeking individuals and enterprises whose incentives are similar to those prevailing in a market economy.</p>
<p>During that meeting, and a five-day meeting to follow in Beijing in June 1986 involving three other outside economists, John Fei of Yale, Anthony Koo of Michigan State and Lawrence Lau of Stanford, the author found the reform officials to be extremely open-minded. Any suggestions could be brought up for discussion. Important considerations are political feasibility and reaction of the population. Ideology becomes an issue only to the extent that Communist Party members and govenment officials with given ideological background needed to understand and be presuaded of the proposal if it is to be put into practice. Other than that I did not experience any more ideological constraints in our discussion and recommendations than in the discussion with economic officials in Taiwan in the 1960s to the 1980s when the same group of economists were advising them.</p>
<p>Concerning housing reform, it was recognized that housing should be ‘commercialized’ in the terminology of the Chinese government. By the ‘commercialization’ of housing, it meant making housing service a commodity subject to the law of demand and supply. One important consideration in housing reform is how to compensate the urban residents who, for several decades, have been accustomed to government subsidized housing. An obvious proposal is to increase urban wage to compensate for the increased cost of rent under a free market for housing. This creates the need to increase prices of products due to the increase in wage cost, which might argue that the effect would be a one-time increase in prices and not an inflationary process. The perception of the population concerning the inflationary process and the redistributional effects of increased rental with wage subsidies were important issues of discussion.</p>
<p>By Chinese official statistics, which follow the statistical system of the former Soviet Union, national output is divided into the five sectors of agriculture, industry, construction, transportation and commerce. In 1978 when reform began, there five sectors accounted respectively for 32.8, 49.4, 4.2, 3.9, and 9.8 percent of national income.<br>Of the total labor force of 401.5 million in 1978, 306.4 million or 76.3 percent were laborers in rural areas while 95.0 million were classified as staff and the remaining 20.5 million worked in collective enterprises in cities and towns.<br>In 1978, 77.6 percent of the gross output value of industry was from state enterprises.</p>
<p>Turning to the demand side, consumer demand in urban areas was controlled by the government in three essential aspects.<br>First, housing of staff and workers was assigned by the unit in which they worked, with negligible rent. There was no market for urban housing.<br>Second, important food items including grain, meat and oil were rationed at below market prices.<br>Third, the purchasing power of the urban consumer was controlled by controlling wage rates.</p>
<p>Two characteristics of the political environment deserve to be noted: The stability of political institutions and the large amount of popular support for economic reform.</p>
<p>Although Deng, Zhao and other leaders were confident of the general direction of reform towards a more market-oriented economy, in the sense of reducing central control and providing economic reward to individuals and economic units willing to produce more, they were not sure of exactly what economic institutions to establish. The procedure followed was one of experimentation. A favorite saying was ‘touching the rocks as you cross the river,’ deciding on the next step only after you have completed the previous step.</p>
<p>While it was easy to adopt the responsibility system in small state enterprises, the system was not easy, and in the early stage of reform not intended, for large enterprises.</p>
<p>Controlling the prices of certain government-distributed products while allowing them to be set in free markets led to a two-tier price system. The welfare effect of such a system was debated by economists. While admitting the virtue of free market prices, some critized the simultaneously existing controlled prices. When the government was the purchaser of certain products at below market prices, the seller essentially paid a tax to the government. If the quantity of government pruchases was fixed, it amounted to a lump sum tax which does not have adverse incentive effects. When the government was the seller of certain products at below market prices, as in the case of material inputs to state enterprises, the purchaser received a subsidy. If the quantity can be increased by negotiation, the purchaser would have an incentive to resell the extra quantities in the free market to make a profit. State enterprises receiving supplies from the government at below market prices dis resell some of the in markets; they also had a competitive edge over other enterprises not receiving the subsidy. Overall, it appeared that the ill-effects from subsidies might be outweighted by the positive effects of making the products available in free markets to benefit the consumers or producers. The Oct 1984 Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party singled out price reform as one of its important components. The decontrol and resetting of prices have continued until today.</p>
<p>As the sixth step in the reform process, China expaned foreign trade and encouraged foreign investment in an open-door policy.<br>Foreign trade and investments have performed three significant functions in China’s economic development.<br>First, foreign investment augments domestic investment in the process of capital accumulation while foreign trade expands China’s prodution possibility frontier inclusive of trade.<br>Second, foreign investment and trade are channels through which updated technology and management practices are introduced into China in the process of learning by doing.<br>Third, and not the least, joint ventures, foreign enterprises, and foreign trade provide competition to Chinese state and collective enterprises, forcing them to be more efficient and at the same time putting pressure on the Chinese price system to reflect the forces of demand and supply.</p>
<p>In Oct 1992, some fourteen years after the official begining of economic reform introduced by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party in 1978, the Congress of the Communist Party was able to adopt a resolution moved by Deng Xiaoping to declare that China’s national output was produced by profit-seeking economic units. In 1992, real national income increased by 12 percent by official statistics,, with most observers projecting a 10-year growth rate averaging 7 to 9 percent. Private enterprises were flourishing. China had already become essentially a market economy.</p>
<p>While meeting with Secretary-General Zhao on Thursday, November 3, 1988, I discussed the possibility of having more political freedom, including freedom of speech, of publication and of assembly, and the possibility of promoting the respect for law in China. The Secretary-General believes that China can make progress towards having more political freedom and respect for the law, but the process, as I see it, is probably going to be slow given China’s historical and political background. After the meeting, it become clear to me that if Mainland China practiced political freedom and the respect for the law, which is being practiced in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong people would increase their confidence in the government of the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Concerning foreign investment, I wrote in Princeton Alumni Weekly (Sept. 1989) that ‘New Foreign investment has slackened not because of morality, but because investors are recalculating their risks. As long as investors believe that investment in China will be profitable and not unduly risky, they will continue to invest.’ This applies especially to the people in Hong Kong and Taiwan, even though they had much stronger emotional reaction to Tiananmen Square than others. Economic dependence on China is stronger in these two lands than elsewhere. Using low-cost labor in China, manufactures in Hong Kong and Taiwan can compete effectively in the world market, so their entrepreneurs have powerful incentives to maintain their manufacturing facilities in China and to establish new ones. Investment and trade from other Asian nations, including Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, have been affected only slightly by the unrest.</p>
<p>Inflation means rapid increase in the general price level. The price level can be measured by a price index which is an average of the prices of many commodities at a given time, as compared with similar average at a base period. Two commonly used general price indices in the United States are the consumer price index (CPI) and the Gross National Product (GNP) deflator. The former is the average price of a standard bundle of consumer goods used by a typical household. It measures how the monetary cost of living of such households changes. The latter is an average of the prices of all commodities (including producer goods as well as consumer goods) and services that are produced by an economy in a given period. Its increase provides a broader definition of inflation than the increase in the CPI.</p>
<p>Since price is an exchange rate between units of money and units of a physical commodity or a service, prices would rise if there are more units of money chasing after (offered to buy) the same quantites of physical commodities and services.</p>
<p>Most economists agree that without going through the increase in money supply the other causes cannot generate inflation.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1988 when inflation became serious, the government tried to restrict the increase in money and credit by assiging credit quotas to banks in different regions and provinces. In addition interest rates on bank deposits were raised to attract deposits and to reduce the quantity of money in circulation, thus making the price level lower than otherwise. Although administrative means such as the assignment of credit quotas to banks were employed because of the absence of a modern banking system for monetary control by economic means, the Chinese officials did use some economic tools such as raising interest rates to control inflation.</p>
<p>In summary, historical records on the policies to deal with inflation in 1985, 1988 and 1993 show that the Chinese government was able to control inflation each time. The question is, will the Chinese government continue to do so in the future, at least in the remaining years of the 1990s. My answer is a qualified yes, subject to some uncertainty.</p>
<p>We understand that monetary stimulation can be successful only if applied occasionally and under the environment of a stable price level. As Milton Friedman has put the point aptly by an analogy. Increasing money supply to an economy is like feeding alcoholic drinks to a person. A small quantity used when the economy or the person is in a normal and stable condition does sometimes help to stimulate, but continued usage of a large quantity will lead to malfunctioning and collapse. I hope that most Chinese government officials appreciate this point. </p>
<p>One element that affects the quality of some Chinese economic statistics from the viewpoint of the user is the incomplete description of the method of construction. Examples are price indexes and indexes of national income in constant prices of selected years. Documentation and description of sources and methods of construction for national income data are much less detailed than can be found in the statistical appendixes of the ‘National Income’ issues of the Survey of Current Business. The poor standard of documentation is one aspect of the underdeveloped state of statistical work in China. In addition, detailed documentation of certain statistical series may reveal information regarded as confidential by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Therefore, in computing national output in 1952 prices, the relative weight given to industrial output compared with agricultural output is about three times the relative weight applied when 1980 prices are used. Chow (1985) estimated the annual growth rate of industry to be about 11% and that of agriculture and other sectors to be about 1.9%, using official data. A large weight given to industry can produce a high rate of growth of 6.0% per year. By using 1980 prices and thus giving a small weight to industrial output, one would obtain an average rate of growth in real national income between 1952 and 1980 of 3.9% per year iinstead of 6.0%. The 3.9% growth rate is more meaningful because the high prices assigned to industrial products in 1952 are arbitrary and because the growth of future real output will be measured by using prices close to 1980 prices. It is interesting to note that, according to the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States (1979), Gross National Product of the People’s Republic of China was estimated to be $99 billion in 1952 and $444 billion in 1978, implying an annual growth rate of 5.94%.</p>
<p>(Houthakker) The elasticity for food with respect to total expenditure might be higher for the countries and time periods with lower total expenditure, though the evidence is equivocal.</p>
<p>A major landmark of economic reform was the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist party of China on Reform of the Economic Structure of Oct 20, 1984. The decision includes the following major components concerning the operation of the domestic economy.<br>First, we should extend the decision-making power of enterprises owned by the whole people… on the premise of following the state plans and subjecting itself to state control, the enterprise has the power to adopt flexible and diversified forms of operation; plans its production, supply and marketing; keep and budget funds it is entitled to retain; appoint, remove, employ or elect its own personnel according to its relevant regulations; decide on how to recruit and use its work force, ad on wages and rewards; set the prices of its products within the limits prescribed by the state; and so on. In short, the enterprise should be truly made a relatively independent economic entity and … responsible for its own profit ad loss and … act as a legal person with certain rights and duties.<br>Second, concerning central planning, the ‘socialist state institutions must manage, inspect, guide and regulate the activities of the enterprises, as is necessary, through planning and by economic, administrative and legal means; … it must designate, appoint and remove the principle leading members of the enterprises or approve their appointment and election … for a considerably long time to come, our national economic plans on the whole can only be rough and elastic and … we can do no more than, by striking an overall balance in planninng and through regulation by economic means, exercise effective control over major issues while allowing flexibility on minor ones … the socialist planned economy is a planned commodity economy based on public ownership, in which the law of value must be consciously followed and applied. ‘<br>Third, concerning price reform, ‘The irrational system of pricing is closely related to the irrational system of price control. In readjusting prices, we must reform the over-centralized system of price control, gradually reducing the scope of uniform prices set by the state and appropriately enlarging the scope of floating prices within certain limits and of free prices. Thus prices will respond rather quickly to changes in labor productivity and the relation between market supply and demand …’ However, market price determination was somewhat restricted. ‘All enterprises should achieve better economic results through efforts to improve management and operation and should never try to increase their income by price increases. It is absolutely impermissible for any unit or person to boost prices at a general rise in prices, disrupt the socialist market and harm the interests of the states and the consumers.’ The Decision also allowed the market sector of collective and individual enterprises to expand. Wage rates were to be differentiated enough ‘to apply fully the principle of rewarding the diligent and good, punishing the lazy and bad, and of giving more pay for more work and less pay for less work …’</p>
<p>A slogan used by Chiese reform officials since 1985 was ‘Invigorate the microeconomic units and control by macroeconomic means.’ This is another way of describing the policy stated in the Decision of Oct 1984 to change from compulsory planning to guidance planning: ‘A planned economy does not necessarily mean the predominance of mandatory planning, both mandatory and guidance planning being its specific forms … guidance plans are fulfilled mainly by use of economic levers; mandatory plans have to be implemented, but even then the law of value must be observed.’</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the present Chinese economic system, with proper management, is capable of achieving a fairly high level of performance to generate a reasonably rapid rate of economic development. This conclusion is based on the following three propositions, each to be discussed in turn.<br>Proposition 1.<br>A decentralized socialist market economy, of properly designed, can perform somewhat between 60 and 100 percent as efficiently as a capitalist market economy. By ‘60 percent efficiency’ is meant producing 60 percent of the output using the same amount of resources.</p>
<p>Proposition 2.<br>The combination of economic planning with market socialism or capitalism can make the economic system work about as well, if not better, than pure market socialism or capitalism.</p>
<p>Proposition 3.<br>Monopolistic and rent-seeking behavior on the part of state enterprise managers and government bureaucrats in China affects the distribution of income but might not seriously affect the efficient working of the market.</p>
<p>The fact that the Chinese economy has grown substantially in the last decade is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that it will grow at similar rates in the next two decades. Some reservations have been voiced.<br>First, the economic momentum generated by the reform will run out of steam. In particular, reform in agriculture increased efficiency in terms of rasing output per capita as compared with farming under Commune system, but once the level of output per capita is raised, no further increase is expected. In fact, the record of agricultural output since 1985 has ben poor. This is a valid point, except that the energy of the farmers unleashed by the present system (in spite of the uncertainty about the right of long-term land use) has been applied to work in light industry, and in commercial and other more productive pursuits in the rural areas, and that the process of technological change in the form of the changing occupation and production mix in China’s countryside has continued and is expected to continue, thus helping to raise output per capita in rural areas.<br>Second, inexperienced macroeconomic management in an environment of imperfect macroeconomic institutions may destroy the economic fabric for further growth. This is a serious possibility. Like other observers, I am concerned about the current inflation, but it is my judgement that the Chinese government will succeed in preventing it from getting out of hand, even if some arbitrary controls might be applied and the progress of price reform might be slower than in the absence of inflation. Like many economists who appreciate the distinction between the flexibility of relative prices and the control of the (average) price index, I believe that it is possible for the Chinese government to control inflation whlie allowing prices of individual products to remain fairly free.<br>One well-known experience is the control of the inflation in Taiwan in the 1950s, when aggregate demand for consumer goods and the velocity of currency circulation were reduced significantly by raising the rates of interest, following advice given by Sho-chieh Tsiang to the Taiwan government.<br>High interest rates as recommended above, in order to be effective, have to be accompanied by stopping the rapid increase in money supply.<br>Third, some observers are concerned that the reform process will stop. As I have argued above, reasonable economic progress in China can occur without significant further reforms in economic institutions. The present system is good enough, although it can be better under Chinese socialism as put forward by the October 1984 Decision. Supporting this argument further is the open-door policy, which will continue to provide energy to China’s economic growth of foreign in the form of capital and technology import, and of setting examples for and providing competition to Chinese State enterprises. The contribution to economic growth of foreign investment, and of collective and private enterprises, has been evident in the province of Guangdong, neighboring Hong Kong.</p>
<p>China may be slow in correcting the present deficiencies of the economic system. These deficiencies include the dependency of labor on the iron rice bowl, the dependency of state enterprises on the government for financial help, a certain amount of corruption, the lack of proficiency in economic planning and macroeconomic management, and the poor environment for foreign investment.</p>
<p>It is my conclusion that market socialism combined with a certain degree of central planning will succeed in modernizing China. This conclusion does not rule out the possibility that capitalism may be better than socialism under other circumstances. Most people living in a capitalist society prefer capitalism as a form of economic organization. China has a very different historical experience from the United States. How feasible and desirable capitalism is under China’s political and economic situation are difficult questions to answer. Many Chinese leaders believe that socialism is more desirable for China, although many young people in China are questioning this view. Since the end of the Second World War, under the leadership of the United States and Soviet Union, capitalist and communist countries have been engaged in a cold war. People and intellectuals on each side have criticized the other system while arguing the superiority of their own. The Chinese economic experiment, by combining socialism with market incentives, may help resolve the conflict in economic ideas and hasten the end of the Cold War. </p>
<p>The hypothesis of asset management:<br>A person managing an asset will, to the best of his or her knowledge, try to derive the most benefit from it, in (a) utilizing its services directly himself or herself, (b) allowing others to use its services, or (c) delivering it to others.</p>
<p>Law of supply of asset service<br>When the marginal benefit from providing the service of an asset is smaller (larger), the asset manager will supply less (more) of its service.</p>
<p>Law of asset delivery<br>When the marginal benefit from delivery or surrending an asset to others is smaller (larger), the asset manager will be less (more) willing to deliver it, possibly reducing the qualities of delivery in the form of delays or lower product quality.</p>
<p>Law of asset maintenance<br>When the benefit of managing an asset, either through the use of its service or through surrending it to others, is smaller (larger), the manager will be less (more) willing to maintain it or to improve upon it.</p>
<p>Law of rent seeking<br>When opportunities to extract payment or benefit from providing the service of an asset or from delivering it to others are available and not unduly risky, the manager will take advantage of them.</p>
<p>First, financial items are not included in the objective function so that there is no reason to economize on the use of inputs. Second, insofar as an increase of output is desirable and can be achieved by an increase of the use of inputs, there is an incentive for the manager to negotiate for more material and other inputs, hence the soft-budget constraint.</p>
<p>The differences in behavior between model A under central planning and model B prevailing after urban economic reforms in 1980s are that in the latter case there is a tendency to maximize profits by increasing management effort, and that there is a tendency to economize on the use of material inputs because profits enter the objective function of the manager. Note, however, that these tendencies are weak if the relative elasticity parameter θ is large, reflecting the unimportance of marginal profits in the manager’s utility function. This is the case for large and medium-size state enterprises, as compared with small state enterprises. In large state enterprises, marginal profits yield only small benefits to the manager, after an allowable amount of profit has been used for distribution as bonuses to management, staff and workers, both in cash and in the form of consumer durables. By contrast, the high profit incentive for the owner-manager of a private enterprise in a market economy is captured in model B, with θ set equal to zero. The appropriate link between marginal profts and the manager’s marginal benefits remains a serious problem in enterprise reform in China.</p>
<p>If one accepts the empirical finding of no technological change in China from 1952 to 1980, one may try to explain why it happened. It is an accepted fact that the Chinese economic planners tried to introduce industrial technology and the method of planning from the Soviet Union in the 1950s and began the First Five-Year Plan in 1953. The Chinese planners also tried to increase output by investing a large fraction of national output in industry, especially heavy industry. This paper has described the increases in outputs in five sectors and in total through capital formation in these sectors by using sectorial and aggregate production functions. These is no reason to assume that technological progress occurred during the period up to 1980. Economic cooperation with the Soviet Union ended in the 1960s. Without incentives from private enterprises to innovate, where could technological progress have come? I have found no theory to support the assertion that central planning will produce technological progress. It might happen, as suggested by Young [1992] for the case of Singapore, that much government direction in industrial investment does not lead to an increase in total factor productivity. Although technological progress defined in the context of Solow’s [1956] growth model is an important phenomenon to explain for a market economy like the United States, one cannot presume its existence in a country like China during a period when private initiatives for innovations or adopting new technology from abroad appeared to be absent. For such an economy one does not need to find explanations for the varying rates of productivity changes as Romer [1987] attempted to do for the United States. However, after the reforms in the 1980s when profit-seeking enterprises began to grow, the study of technological progress in China is an important and interesting topic for further research.</p>

            <p>It aims to give a picture of the adjustments between agriculture and industry during the process of industrialization. The emphasis, however, will be laid upon the adjustments in agriculture and its adaptation to change.<br>There are several sets of questions with which this study particularly attempts to deal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is industrial development a necessary or a sufficient condition for agricultural reform in a densely populated rural region, or vice versa?<br>In order to answer this question, the process of industrialization in general and the basic factors affecting it will be studied. The interdependence of agriculture and industry and the mutual effects of industrial and agricultural developments will be emphasized and analyzed.</li>
<li>Is it possible to maintain a balance between agriculture and industry within a given country? If it is, how? If not, why? Is there a third answer?</li>
<li>Is it possible to maintain harmonies and mutually beneficial relations between countries primarily agricultural and those essentially industrial? If, in an agricultural country, the process of industrialization sets in, what are the possible effects of this on the countries already highly industrialized?<br>To answer these questions requires a study of trade and capital movement between agricultural and industrial countries.</li>
<li>Keeping in mind all the implications and complications raised above, what are the particularly pressing problems which would most probably confront an agricultural country during its process of industrialization?</li>
</ol>
<p>The general equilibrium approach provides no place for an industry.<br>The general equilibrium approach assumes ‘perfect competition’, and in the theory of production it assumes ‘fixed’ technological coefficients of production. Their analysis is entirely ‘static’.</p>
<p> The partial equilibrium approach (or the Marshallian type of analysis) differs from the general equilibrium approach (or the Walrasian type of analysis) in that, for a given instant (or period) of time, it confines itself to the study of one phenomenon, or the relationship between two phenomena, while it assumes that other phenomena remain constant, using the famous phrase of ‘other things being equal’.</p>
<p>The theory of imperfect or monopolistic competition modifies the classical theories in two ways.<br>First, it introduces the theory of the firm in addition to that of the group or the industry, which has constituted the main skeleton of the Marshallian analysis.<br>In the second place, the theory replaces the assumption of perfect or pure competition by one of imperfect or monopolistic competition. While perfect competition may serve as an ideal case in which the equilibrium analysis is especially useful, the theory of imperfect competition is justified in claiming to be more realistic and under its analysis the perfect competition would be treated as a special case.<br>But it is to be pointed out that under imperfect and monopolistic competition the use of equilibrium analysis is greatly limited. Because of the genetic characteristics, it is impossible to have a stable equilibrium either for a firm or for a group (industry).<br>In spite of these limitations, the theory of imperfect competition would still find valuable application to the present study.</p>
<p>All agricultural or rural markets are in no way free from special institutional restraints, nor from geographical and physical hindrances. In other words, prices and the mobility of resources are far from being unrestricted. Furthermore, the farm or rural family as an economic unit does not possess complete knowledge, and is, in most cases, much less favorably informed of the market news than the economic units in an urban area. The market from that we really have in a rural community is usually either a ‘monopsony’ or an ‘oligopsony’. As to the production structure, it is nothing new to say that response of farmers or farms to changes in prices is very slow and in some cases even nil.</p>
<p>Any analysis, either purely theoretical or historical, of the functional relationship between agriculture and industry requires an application of the theory of imperfect competition if the results are to be in accord with what has happened in the economic society and what would most likely happen under the present economic system.</p>
<p>The limitations of the aggregative equilibrium approach as applied to the present study would be greater than has been stated by Schumpeter in dealing with business cycles as quoted in the above paragraph. This is because any dealing with the characteristics of an industry or the relations between two industries would lose its significance in dealing only with total output and total income and their relations to quantity of money, rate of interest, and price level. The latter would in general give us no information about the former.</p>
<p>The new approach (location theory) does in no way rely on mathematical treatment. This is because the mathematical treatment would have to be based on the assumption that economic activity takes place upon a completely undifferentiated plane surface, which, by no means, fits the reality.<br>The central thesis of the new approach may be stated thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is desirable to direct our interest in the first instance towards the broader aspect of the developing patterns of population density.</li>
<li>It is desirable to study the relations of these patterns to localized resources and to the significance that regional resources possess under technological conditions of each historical period.</li>
<li>It is necessary also to recognize explicitly the significance of accessibility of resource deposits to long-distance trade.</li>
<li>The study of differences in accessibility requires careful analysis of the topography of the primary regions of the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>The usefulness of the location theory for our present study lies not only in that it brings into the pricture the locational aspect of the problem, but also in that, as has been undertaken by the dynamic approach of the theory, it points out the changes of the basic locational factor from one historical period to another, and upon this factor other economic activities are to be focused.</p>
<p>With the new approach of the location theory – or it may be called ‘the general and dynamic location theory’ – there is intrinsically no need for making a distinction between agricultural and industrial location. The new approach emphasizes in general the population settlement, utilization (and limitation) of resources, and the working relationship of the two. Relations of agriculture to industry during the process of industrialization, therefore, can be explained by that approach only in general terms, but not in specific details. </p>
<p>As Lionel Robbins has brilliantly remarked:<br>in the realm of Applied Economics, some division of labour is essential, and theory cannot be fruitfully applied to the interpretation of concrete situations unless it is informed continually of the changing background of the facts of particular industires. But, as experience shows, sectional investigations conducted in isolation are exposed to very grave dangers. If continual vigilance is not exercised they tend to the gradual replacement of economic by technological interests. The focus of attention becomes shifted, and a body of generalizations which have only technical significance comes to masquerade as Economics. And this is fatal. For, since the scarcity of means is relative to ‘all’ ends, it follows that an adequate view of the influences governing social relationships in their economic aspects can only be obtained by viewing the economic system as a whole. The raison detre, indeed, is the existence of other industries, and their fortunes can only be understood in relation to the whole network of economic relationships. It follows, therefore, that studies which are exclusively devoted to one industry or occupation are continually exposed to the danger of losing touch with the essentials. Their attention may be supposed to be directed to the study of prices and costs, but they tend continually to degenerate either into mere accountancy or into amateur technology. The existence of this danger is no ground for dispensing with this kind of investigation. But it is fundamental that its existence should be clearly recognized. Here, as elsewhere, it is the preservation of a proper balance which is important.</p>
<p>That tool has been applied by C. W. Wright to the study of the economic development of the United States. In his analysis of the main factors which underlie the transformation of American manufacturing, Wright stresses three sets as fundamental:<br>(1) the comparative cost of the main factors of production;<br>(2) transportation and related costs as limiting the area within which exchange based on differences in comparative costs could take place;<br>(3) the group of artificial factors, based mainly on legislation, tending to restrict or to stimulate manufacturing development.</p>
<p>If the natural growth of population and the occupational shift occur at the same time, the problem of food supply appears to be essentially the same. If we assume that there are no changes in taste and in farm technology, the means to meet the deficiency in food supply would consist of any of the following three methods:<br>extensive cultivation (more land),<br>intensive cultivation (more labor on the same land),<br>or import from outside (interregional trade);<br>or a combination of any two, or of all three of them.</p>
<p>In an agricultural country, or in a country during the stage in which agricultural production is of primary importance and a larger proportion of the people are rural, the distribution of population is determined mainly by food production.</p>
<p>Thus, ‘prior to the eighteenth century, export industry was located in large measure in regions of cheap food production or in regions where food was cheap by reason of easy transport conditions.’</p>
<p>From this it is clear that for any country, before industrial revolution took place, food was the main factor for the localization of all economic activities – industrial, commercial, or otherwise. As soon as industrialization in a country is appreciably under way, food resources begin to have less importance as a locational factor.</p>
<p>The relationship among the three factors – price elasticity of demand, income elasticity of demand, and elasticity of substitution – is very well described by Hick’s and Allen’s simple and standard formula, stating that the price elasticity of demand is a weighted average of the income elasticity of demand and the elasticity of substitution.</p>
<p>But history has shown that progress in farm technology always goes side by side with industrial development. The question then becomes one of the difference in the rate of progress between farm technology and industrial development.</p>
<p>The acceleration principle has been widely used for describing and explaining business cycles. As it has been well elaborated by Haberler, the principle states that “Changes in demand for, and production of, finished goods and services tend to give rise to much greater changes in the demand for, and production of, those producers’ goods which are used for their production.”</p>
<p>From some statistical data of longer periods several conclusions about the relationship may be drawn. First, both the agricultural and industrial prices have the same trend.<br>Second, the amplitude of change in agricultural prices is always greater than in industrial prices. This is the essence of the acceleration principle.<br>Finally, there is a lag of one, two, or three years in the changes of agricultural prices behind the changes of industrial prices.<br>These three – same trend, the accelerating effect, and a lag in change – are the main features pertaining to production of any two successive stages which are far enough apart to be distinguished from one another. In a way, it may be described as the relationship between demand (industry) and the derived demand (agriculture).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we, in explaining economic progress and cyclical fluctuations under the modern capitalistic system, adopt a view that only the enterprising spirit and technology are generating factors, while the institutional forms, such as production structure and trade organizations, are at most modifying and shaping factors, the present controversy is almost entirely irrelevant.</p>
<p>The optimum population is that population which, with given amountsof other factors (including land, productive technique, capital, and organization), will produce the ‘maximum product.’ Any increase or decrease of the population above or below that size will diminish the product. This optimum, in contrast with the one proposed by J. S. Mill, is not a size fixed for all time: it is determined only by reference to all the other data of the economic system.</p>
<p>The basic reason for occupational shifts, as revealed in the labor transfer from agriculture to other production fields, may be found in the differences of the per-capita monetary returns. While it is difficult to make any accurate calculation concerning the incomes derived from agriculture, it seems safe to say that, excluding large farmers in the newer countries, planatation owners in colonial countries, and a few large European farmers – these form only a very small proportion of the total number of farmers – the actual return per capita from farming is smaller than that derived from industrial, commercial, and professional occupations. Such a difference or gap becomes greater when industrial and commercial expansion is on the way, especially during early stages of industrialization.</p>
<p>Such a type of occupational shift – a permanent or long-run transfer from agriculture to other production fields – is among the main features that characterize the process of industrialization.</p>
<p>But, in the last analysis, in a society where industrialization has already begun, power resources, of which coal is most representative, are to be regarded as the main factor in the localization of economic activities. This is because in modern society some industries which must use coal as power have become so predominant that other economic activities must be accordingly adjusted and reoriented. In this case, labor as a social factor of production must submit to the power resoruces which are geographically localized.</p>
<p>Therefore, industrialization is, in a way, a process in which scales and ranges of increasing returns are continuously created, and in due time respectively prolonged and enlarged.</p>
<p>There is a well-known list, suggested by Frank H. Knight, to cover the ‘factor in regard to which change or the possibility of change must be studied.’ These factors are the data for economic theory and are the objects of study for the theory of economic development. The list includes the following factors or independent variables.</p>
<ol>
<li>The population, numbernd composition.</li>
<li>The tastes and dispositions of the people.</li>
<li>The amounts and kinds of production capacities in existence, including<br>a) Personal powers<br>b) Material agents</li>
<li>The distribution of ownership of these, including all rights of control by persons over persons or things.</li>
<li>Geographic distribution of people and things.</li>
<li>The state of the arts; the whole situation as to science, education, technology, social organization, etc.<br>There is no reason to assume that these factors or variables are entirely independent of any change in other factors or variables. In a longer run, these independent variables may also become dependent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us take tastes as an example. According to Roll, there are three kinds of changes in tastes or consumers’ preference The first are ‘autonomous’ changes, the causes of which cannot be easily ascertained; the second are ‘repercussive’ changes, which are themselves the results of changes in population, capital, productivity, and so on; and, finally, there are changes in tastes which are deliberately brought about; they are ‘induced.’ It is only the first kind of changes that can claim to be independent.</p>
<p>If this argument is carried too far, it will lead to a situation where none of the factors in economic society can be taken as independent, because all factors are, in one way or another, interdependent and interacting. Thus a point must be found on which to stop and stand. In order to build a theory or a systematic argument to explain economic phenomena so complicated, especially because the complexity increases as the period or process of evolution is further prolonged, the concepts of ‘partial’ interdependence and ‘relative’ continuity have to be used instead of the general and the absolute ones.</p>
<p>After this reclassification, the following four fundamental factors are obtained for explaining the process of industrial evolution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Population – number, composition, and geographical distribution</li>
<li>Resources or material agents – kinds, amounts, and geographical distribution</li>
<li>Social institutions – the distribution of ownership of productive agents, personal and material</li>
<li>Technology – emphasis to be laid on the application of inventions, while conditions of science, education, and social organization are considered outside the scope of present discussion.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship – changing the production function or applying a new production function.</li>
</ol>
<p>These five factors, to the present writer, are the most important ones in generating and shaping the process of industrial evolution. But their natures and influences are different, and can be further grouped into two classes. I consider entrepreneurship and technology as generating factors; resources, population, and social institutions as limitational factors.</p>
<p>But what we emphasize here is the ‘enterprising spirit’ which lies behind, and leads onward, the enterprising actions. Sombart has interpreted this spirit as a mental attitude which is dominated by the principles of acquisition, of competition, and of economic rationality. He considers the ‘enterprising spirit,’ together with ‘form’ (regulation and organization) and ‘technical methods’ as the three basic characteristics that constitute the essence of modern capitalism. Of these three, the aspect which he most strongly emphasizes is that of the enterprising spirit. As he said, ‘at different times different attitudes toward economic life have prevailed, and that it is the enterprising spirit which created a suitable form for itself and has thus created economic organization.’ This spirit is more than the ‘motive of maximizing profit’ which, together with the motive of maximizing satisfaction, makes a rational ‘economic man’ and constitutes one of the most fundamental assumptions in economic theory. The former is broader because it includes, most important, the spirit or the intention of ‘enterprising for enterprising itself,’ in addition to ‘enterprising for profit.’<br>The enterprising spirit is a fundamental generating factor for the rise and vigorous development of the so-called ‘commercial capitalism’ in the latter Middle Ages, the characteristics of which consist of adventurous undertakings in new territories, improvement of navigation and advance of commercial organization. These commercial changes that have broadened the market for industries to the greatest extent ever seen in history, together with the mechanical achievements (technological progress) that for the first time made themselves especially apparent at the end of the eighteenth century, have contributed most greatly to making the process of industrial revolution a reality.<br>Of course one must never fail to recognize that the interplay of several factors is in reality more essential than the acting of any factor alone. But this need not in any sense belittle the primary importance of the enterprising spirit in generating a process that let toward modern capitalism. I used to think that lack of such a spirit in Chinese tradition helped to explain why industrial revolution has not taken place spontaneously within the Chinese economy. In considering this particular problem, one must, of course, also take into account other factors, such as geographical situation, attitude toward scientific research, and government policies. It is to be noted, however, that the enterprising spirit itself is conditioned, or at least influenced, by cultural inheritance. It should also be recognized that only after technological progress has reached a certain stage can the spirit be fully expressed and magnified.</p>
<p>As Sombart has well said, what characterizes modern technique is that it is scientic. Science and technique are so closely related as to represent the theoretical and practical sides of the same movement. The medieval technique was on the one hand tranditional, as received from a master and handed down; on the other hand it was empirical, relying upon experience for instruction and not on objective scientific reasoning… Thus modern technique is both rational and scientific.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the labor-saving invention has been the more frequent in history; and, in early days of industrial revolution, it was the introduction of labor-saving machinery that aroused the antagonism of workers and their sympathizers.</p>
<p>As technological changes are introduced, limits as set by resources may be partially lifted, or may be shifted or changed to that of a different category. As a matter of fact, efforts of technology have been usually directed to overcoming the difficulties caused by the shortage or lack of certain materials. Crowded Europe has suffered from an inadequancy of raw materials. Her effort therefore, has to be concentrated upon exploiting to the fullest possible measure the resources which she does posses and upon finding substitutes for those which are lacking and which cannot be readily obtained from the outside. In other words, her effort has to be, in general, centered upon the invention of material-saving devices, as contrasted with the labor-saving devices of the United States. Progress in chemistry in Europe, especially in Germany, serves as a good illustration.</p>
<p>The rate of population growth, especially in the process of industrialization, is of interest because it fits into our dynamic analysis. From the experience of various industrialized countries, a pattern of the trend of population may be drawn. During the initial stage of industrialization, a rapid decline in the death rate takes place, making possible a huge expansion of population, and is followed in later stages by an accelerating decline of the birth rate, which in more advanced countries has reduced population growth with the imminent prospect of bringing it to an end.</p>
<p>Industrialization may be achieved under different patterns, or types, of forms, according to certain criteria we use for the classification. First of all, according to the amount of initiative taken by government and individual, industrializtion may be classified into three types:<br>(1) individual-or-private-initiated;<br>(2) government-initiated;<br>(3) jointly initiated.</p>
<p>It is more appropriate to call the process started under government initiative a revolution, because it is more sudden and phenomenal.</p>
<p>It is obvious that personal freedom, which includes freedom to move, freedom to buy and sell, and free choice of occupation, is an important condition for modern economic development characterized by the rise and expansion of modern capitalism.</p>
<p>But I want to stress the point that personal freedom is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for modern idustrial development.</p>
<p>The influences of war on economic expansion may be approached from three angles. First, war creates demand, and hence stimulates the introduction of new products and the use of substitutes which can be more advantageously produced at home. It stimulates employment, and presents a necessity for introducing technological changes, either labor-saving or material-saving. Finally, it helps wash of social reform regarding the distribution of income and the ownership of property. Thus, we may safely conclude that war is a stimulating factor for economic expansion, and provides favorable chances, of course for the victorious country only, to start and, if already started, to hasten the process of industrialization.</p>
<p>The process of industrialization is only another way of stating the sequence of technological changes in modern economic society.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the whole production structure of a society, the main characteristic of industrialization is the relative increase of capital goods and the relative decrease of consumption goods. In this sence, industrialization may be defined as ‘capitalization’ of production; in order words, production in a more roundabout way.</p>
<p>The fact that industrialization started often with textiles may be explained by the following reasons.<br>First, the elasticity of demand for clothing is greater than that for food, although both of them are inelastic (less than unity) in the modern concept. In the early period of industrialization, products of groups other than clothing and food were less known either owing to technical impossibility or because demand for them had not been created. Thus, the texitiles, either cotton, silk, or wool, which had long been the backbone of domestic industries, or industries under the ‘merchant-employer system,’ had the privilege and a more favorable chance of being the first to undergo the process of industrial transformation.<br>Secondly, form the location point of view, food crops are, to a large extent, ubiquitous, while cotton, silk, and wool are mostly localized. Trade of localized products is bound to be more frequent, and its amount greater. It need not be said that trade gives stimulation to production.<br>Also, the mobility of texitile goods is much higher than that of food products because of a lesser extent of bulkiness and perishability. The mobility of the latter was very limited before modern storage and the refrigeration system came into use.<br>Finally, from the technical point of view, the textile industries require more skill in production, and hence need labor training more than many other industries. The textile industries need laborers not only of greater skill, but also in a larger amount, so far as the internal production structure is concerned. such a technical requirement gives the textiles an advantage, and at the same time creates a necessity that labor surplus in rural areas during the initial period of industrialization be absorbed.<br>Furthermore, the textile industries, at least compared with food industries, are more subject to specialization, and hence to concentration, which means large production in one process. This further indicates that they are more suitable for modern organization.<br>The mechanical inventions in the textiles, which themselves have been conditioned by the demand and economic situation, have made it possible for the textile industries to expand and develop.</p>
<p>Failure to express the qualitative side of the technological changes involved in an evolutionary process is an inherent defect and hence a serious limitation to the method of quantitative approach.</p>
<p>This leads to the conclusion that the countries in which industrialization started the latest are, in general, those in which the speed is the greatest. This is so because countries begining the process of industrialization later usually have greater advantages of introducing the most up-to-date technology.</p>
<p>Industrialization as a process characterized by technological changes has three obvious effects: first, it changes the proportions of the factors; second, it tends to reduce the price of capital; and third, it provides an ever increasingly favorable condition for the substitution of capital for labor. On the whole, these effects will tend to raise capital’s elasticity of substitution.</p>
<p>The difference in the rate of growth in the fields under conparison is chiefly due to the difference in the income elasticity of demand for their products and services and also due to their various degrees of expandibility of production structure as limited by the technological factors.</p>
<p>The final outcome depends on how the marginal productivity of the given factor is affected. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed by Hicks that only two factors, labor and capital, are used in producing a given commodity. Accordingly, improved techniques which affect both absolute and relative shares of the total product limited to the two factors may be calssified as labor-saving, capital-saving, or nuetral. Labor-saving inventions are those which increase the marginal product of capital more than they increase the marginal product of labor. Conversely, capital-saving inventions increase the marginal product of capital less than that of labor. A neutral invention means that the marginal productivities of the two factors are increased in the same proportion.<br>Hick’s analysis is based on two assumptions. One is that in each case the system is in equilibrium and the other is that he ignores completely the possibility of increasing returns. These two assumptions limit, to a great extent, the applicability of his theory to an evolutionary process such as industrialization. But the general principles remain valid and, if supported by empirical verification, may prove useful in suggesting the general direction of the relative importance of labor, or of any other factor of production, as a consequence of technological change.</p>
<p>Once capital, especially in the form of machinery, is invested or installed, there will be a momentum set for its further expansion. Such a self-generating force lies intrinsically in part in the capitalist economic system.</p>
<p>From the above four propositions, it can be clearly seen that in an expansionist economy, the elasticity of demand for labor in industry is on the whole greater than that in agriculture, even given a state of prospective technology. This is so for the following reaosns.<br>First, the elasticity of demand for industrial goods is in general much greater than the elasticity of demand for agricultural goods of which most are food products.<br>Secondly, substitution is more available in industry than in agriculture.<br>Thirdly, considering the fact that the proportion of labor cost in total cost is usually smaller in industry than in agriculture, it may be stated that the demand for labor by industry is less elastic in the aspect. But we also know that the proportions of the factors of production are more easily subject to alteration in industry than in agriculture where land plays a major and rigid role. This would offset, though in varied degrees, the factor just considered.<br>Finally, the supply of other factors is in general more elastic in industry than in agriculture, especially, as we have just pointed out, because land is such an important and rigid factor in agricultural production.</p>
<p>The interregional barriers and poor transportation facilities wihtin China constitute another group of obstacles that have made it very difficult for the free movement of commodities and the factors of production.</p>
<p>Industrialization, as we noted in Chapter III, may simply be called the process of ‘capitalization,’ that is, the process in which widening and deepening of capital are taking place. That process involves, of course, technological changes. Taking the world as a whole, economic development is of different degrees in different countries. There is a natural tendency for the capital to flow from the regions or countries where the marginal producticity of capital is relatively lower to those places where it is higher, if the prospective returns are great enough to compensate for the risk of investment in addition to the transfer cost incurred.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The introduction to this book presented four main problems for analysis. Now, in the light of the foregoing chapters, I shall attempt to answer these major questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is industrial development a necessary or a sufficient condition for agricultural reform in a densely populated rural region, or vice versa?</li>
<li>Is it possible to maintain a balance between agriculture and industry within a given country?</li>
<li>Is it possible to maintain harmonies and mutually beneficial relations between countries primarily agricultural and those essentially industrial, and if, in an agricultural country, the process of industrialization sets in, what are the possible effects of this on the countries already highly industrialized?</li>
<li><p>What are the problems which would most probably confront an agricultural country like China during its process of industrialization?</p>
</li>
<li><p>As to the first of these problems, it may be concluded that industrial development is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for agricultural reform and improvement, if by agricultural reform and improvement we mean mechanization in agriculture and the large-scale organization of farm enerprises.<br>Industrial development is a necessary condition because farm machinery, chemical fertilizers, and other equipment and instruments necessary for modern farming have to be supplied by modern industry. Moreover, only an appreciable rise of people’s income which is to be secured from industrial and commercial expansion can raise, though at a decreasing rate, the demand for farm products and stimulate the improvements in agriculture.<br>But industrial development alone cannot sufficiently induce agricultural reform. Other conditions have to be provided simultaneously or even in advance if agricultural reform and improvement are to be effectively carried out. Among the other conditions the most important are improvements in transport, consolidation of farms, and legal regulations relating to the redistribution of land which will make the large-scale farm organization a reality.<br>Historically it has been shown that among the highly industrialized countries, those which have a higher degree of mechanization in agriculture are also those which have a greater size of farm. Of this group we may mention the United States, Australia, Great Britain, and Soviet Russia. In these countries, industrial development has contributed greatly to agricultural modernization.<br>But other necessary conditions for large-scale and scientific farming should also be recognized. Australia and the United States are new countries in which the institutional obstacles to large-scale farming are much smaller than those in old countries. In Great Britain the system of primogeniture has been among the chief factors keeping the farm holdings from further division. The enclosure movement, twice seen in her history, was as significant as commercial and industrialexpansion in stimulating and facilitating the agriclutural reform and improvement. Soviet Russia has removed all the institutional obstacles to farm reorganization by revolution and thus paved the way for the establishment of state and collective farms.<br>On the other hand, there are several industrialized countries whose agriculture is not highly mechanized partially because of the institutional restrictions standing in the way of farm consolidation and land redistribution.<br>Of this group Japan, Germany, France, and Belgium may be mentioned. Their agricultural improvements have been confined largely to application of chemical fertilizers and adoption of crop rotation and other new farming methods rather than introduction of farm machinery. The high density of population in these countries is also among the serious obstacles. The same explanation may apply to Denmark, though her industrial production is far less important than agricultural.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Answers to the second question, that is, whether in a given country it is possible to maintain a balance between agriculture and industry, depend, first of all, on the concept given to the term ‘balance’.<br>It may be stated in general that in an evolutionary process like industrialization, this question really occupies no place because there is no such thing as balance if used in its genuine sense. Theoretically, we should admit that given a state of technology there should be an optimum point of adjustment between agriculture and industry. This optimum point may be called ‘balance’ or ‘point approaching balance.’ Thus in our evolutionary process, there will be, also theoretically, a series of such points which construct an irregular curve of adjustments between agriculture and industry. However, in reality such optimum points may never be reached. Thus no balance or curve of balance between agriculture and industry can be really attained.<br>Moreover, comparing the two production fields under inquiry, we may say that, while the expansion of agriculture is somehow limited, the expansion of industry is almost indifinite. In an expansionist economy, if given the rate of population growth and the possible change in the size and distribution of income, increase and shifts in the demand for food can, to a large extent, be ascertained. This means that the function of agriculture in supplying food is estimable even in a changing economy. But its function of supplying raw materials cannot be definitely predicted, and it depends in great measure upon the expansion of industry and the development of synthetic products as substitutes. On the whole, the expansion of agriculture can be more or less estimated because supply of food constitutes overwhelmingly its major function.<br>The case is entirely different with industry. There the creation of new products and their expansion are so varied and uncertain as to be in no way predictable. Therefore, in a real changing world, it is impossible to conceive any balance between agriculture and industry, when one of them is almost completely unknown.<br>But the balance between agriculture and industry may be expressed in terms other than the functions performed. It may be measured in terms of national product or national income, or in terms of working population. Neither method is satisfactory, owing to the defects inherent in the quantitative analysis which in no way can express adequately the qualitative changes. Nevertheless, they are the only measures available at the present stage. For this reason, we have employed them in Chapters II and IV to indicate the change of the place of agriculture in relation to industry. The concept of balance in terms of working population has long been emphasized because after all economics is a human science, dealing with the material well-being of mankind. No matter what measure is employed, it has been shown that the relative importance of agriculture in the whole economy has been on the decrease in an expansion process of economic evolution. It is the main due to the relatively lower income-elasticity of demand for farm products. This, however, does not mean that agriculture itself has been declining in the absolute sense. On the contrary, agricultural production has been expanding rapidly since industrialization was first introduced, taking in view the world economy as a whole. Only the rate of expansion is smaller in agriculture than in industry. Thus even in a highly industrialized country that absolute number of working population engaged in agriculture and absolute amount of agricultural production may not decrease at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The question as to whether it is possible to maintain harmonious and mutually beneficial relations between countries primarily agricultural and those predominantly industrial may be answered from an examination of the following two aspects.<br>In the first place, barring the political consideration, the interdependence between the economic activities performed by an agricultural country and those by an industrial country is no less close and profound than the interdependence of economic activities between agriculture and industry within a country. Here there are two points to be considered. On the one hand, the differences in physical factors as indicated by climate and resources and differences in cultural background as revealed in labor skill are greater between countries than within them. Thus the division in production on the international level seems to have a greater range and a higher degree than on the national scale. On the other hand, the necessity of international division of labor is partially offset by the attempt of attaining self-sufficiency as revealed in national economic policies. This attempt was chiefly responsible for the parallel movement in recent decades, that is, the ‘agrarianization’ of industrial countries and the ‘industrialization’ of agricultural countries, the first being especially reactionary and contrary to the trend of economic evolution. These two factors, physical and political, tend always to work in the opposite direction.<br>In the second place, if we approach the problem from a long run point of view and use the concept of industrialization as given in this analysis, then industrialization in agricultural countries would have to be viewed as the inevitable result of beneficial both to the industrializing countries and to those already highly industrialized. It will be so because it will raise the productivitynd the income level of the countries newly under industrialization, and, in turn, raise their marginal propensity to import which will profit the old industrial countries. But, for these benefits, some price must be paid. Industrialization in an agricultural country will undoubtedly have competitive effects on some industries in the old countries. The new industrial country may first reduce some of her imports from the old ones, and later compete with them in a third market. It will compel the old industrial countries to make adjustments in production in one way or another in order to meet the changed situation. To what extent the old industrial countries will benefit from the industrialization of an agricultural country depends in great measure upon its ability to make the adjustments. The adverse effects of this kind and their impact on the adjustments are essentially not very different from those necessarily resulting in the internal economic structure of the agricultural country newly under industrialization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Chapter VI, I attempted to describe and appraise the possible implications and complications raised by the industrialization of an agricultural country. We may be now in a better position to understand the problems of China’s industrialization. The purposes and the scope of this essay do not permit any detailed inquiry into the problem, in Chapter VI only a brief analysis has been made of the role that agriculture will play and the possible adjustments to be made in agriculture during the process of industrialization.<br>Several points pertaining to the case of China may be stated as conclusions.<br>First, it may be said that stimulus for industrialization must be found in sources other than agriculture. This means that agriculture will play only a passive role in the coming process of economic transformation.<br>Second, it has been made evident that industrial development is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for agricultural reform and improvement. This is due, in the main, to the characteristics of the production structure of the fields. The change of the strategical production functions is made possible only when industrial development gets under way. These two may, to a large extent, be identified. The assertion that agriculture may alone develop without relying on industry does not recognize this strategical point.<br>Third, consolidation of farms which presupposes a drastic policy of land reform and improvement is considered most important in addition to the stimulus and support to be received from industrial development.<br>Finally, industrialization of China will undoubtedly have some competitive effects on the old industrial countries in some production lines, but these effects will not be felt for a long period to come. Moreover, they will be partially offset by the increase of the purchasing power of the Chinese people. And if the old industrial countries make efforts to adjust their production accordingly and simultaneously, the industrialization of China and other agricultural countries will lead to a new line of international division of labor which will in the long run prove beneficial both to the agricultural and to the industrial countries. </p>
