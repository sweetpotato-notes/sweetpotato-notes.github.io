        <p>A Critique of welfare economics and the implications for public policy</p>
<p>The Author<br>Professor Cheung’s main approach to research is empirical – he formulates hypotheses and then tests their implications against evidence. His conviction of the importance of property rights in affecting economic behaviour has led to an almost exclusive focus on various aspects of transaction costs. As a price theorist, Professor Cheung typically specifies alternative sets of transaction costs in deriving his hypotheses, and then proceeds to test the implications through thorough investigations of the real-world situations.</p>
<p>Transaction costs may arise as a consequence of </p>
<ul>
<li>first, the inadequate specification of property rights;</li>
<li>second, the nature of the externality;</li>
<li>third, the number of bargarners; and / or</li>
<li>fourth, the inadequacy of the institutions</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Inadequate definition of property rights<br>Without this initial delimitation of property rights, there will be no market transactions – exchange or ‘trade’ – to transfer and recombine them. A clear-cut decision on property rights may thus itself be all that is required to resolve the difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Uncertain effect of externality<br>Where the externality itself is complex and even ambiguous, so that the individuals do not know whether an activity is detrimental or beneficial to themselves, it is impossible to strike a bargain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Bargaining costs<br>Transaction costs may frequently increase with the number of individuals both as a result of increased difficulties in locating all involved and of accurately revealing their preferences.<br>On the assumption of zero transaction costs, Professor Coase argued that the efficient solution would be attained by bargaining irrespective of the initial delimitation of rights. Once there are transaction costs, the effects are less clear-cut.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Failure of legal and political institutions<br>Finally, the transaction costs of resolving an externality problem may be high as a consequence of inadequae institutions. Inevitably, this issue has dominated the debate on policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The most obvious instrument of policy, once property rights are established and bargaining has failed, is court action. In an ideal world, it would suffice. But, in practice, British courts are less than helpful.</p>
<p>Fundamental issues<br>First, no-one should expect that governments will behave simply as social agencies whose sole or primary purpose is to maximise welfare.<br>Second, the evidence is mounting that government sector interventions are themselves excessively costly. The costs of intervention will often exceed the benefits.<br>Third, government should not be assumed to command more knowledge than the individuals affected.<br>Fourth, the implications for individual freedom should not be ignored when assessing the argument for government interention.</p>
<p>On ethics, economic theory must remain silent: no testable propositions can be put forward unless each individual’s judgement is accepted as given. In the seemingly persuasive argument for redistribution of income, economic analysis has failedo produce a convincing measure of a net improvement in ‘welfare’ when $1 of every $100 is taken from one person and given to another.</p>
<p>To accept or to deny the desirability of a public policy necessarily involves ‘normative’ value-judgements on whether it should (or should not) be adopted. Economic efficiency, on the other hand, can be defined in ‘positive’ terms concerned with whether a certain activity is (or is not) efficient. The transition from positive analysis to normative argument on policy requires only the inference that efficient allocation of resources is desirable to society. This inference is easy to draw and, to most economists, easy to accept.</p>
<p>The disagreements usually stem not from conflicting analytical tools but rather from different assumptions. </p>
<p>Pareto condition: a state where it is no longer possible to re-allocate the use of resources so that one individual will gain without loss to another.</p>
<p>The term ‘economic efficiency’ in its standard usage refers to the attainment of maximum aggregate value of goods and services, or maximum value of the scarce resources used to produce them.</p>
<p>A central postulate in economic analysis is that each individual will maximise his real income (or gain) subject to limitations or ‘constraints’, the term used here to include all the factors which restrain an individual from achieving an infinitely high income. They comprise four groups:<br>(1) scarcity of resources;<br>(2) diminishing returns – nature’s law which dictates that one cannot produce an infinite quantity of grain by continuing to add fertilizer to a given piece of land;<br>(3) property rights, which stem from competition for the same resources;<br>(4) transaction costs, which include the costs of searching, negotating and enforcing contracts, and of defining and policing of rights.</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe always efficient</p>
<p>The validity of assumptions in economic analysis has been a confusing issue. An ‘assumption’ sometimes refers to a postulate which cannot be observed, and it is pointless then to question its reality.</p>
<p>Assuming constraints that fail to conform essentially to reality has been a major fallacy in the analysis of social cost.</p>
<p>In Coase’s view therefore, the problem is a reciprocal one, and on efficiency grounds the solution is not simply to restrain the damaging party, but to restrain either the damaging or the damaged party in such a way that the gain for one side cannot be outweighted by the loss to the other, in total and at the margin.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for the consummation of any transaction is that the maximum one party is willing to pay to acquire a right is more than, or at least equal to, the minimum another party is willing to accept to surrender that right.</p>
<p>A more general statement can now be made regarding the constraints under which the traditional measure of economic efficiency will be attained.<br>First, assignment of exclusive rights to either A or B is essential, and either case will yield similar result.<br>(The alternative assignments of rights, involving alternative liability rules and different distributions of wealth, could lead to different patterns of resource use due to the distribution effects, but this would not affect efficiency.)<br>A second constraint is that all costs associated with making transactions ar zero.<br>These two propositions summarise what has been called the Coase theorem.</p>
<p>Complications</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncertain transaction costs<br>Either party may capture the entire amount; but no criterion or mechanism is specified through which a division may be determined, and without an answer to this question we cannot predict the behavior of the individual parties.<br>Bilateral monopoly<br>The important conclusion is that the solution becomes mechanical once the nature and magnitude of transaction costs, together with other constraints, are sufficiently specified.</li>
<li>High transaction costs<br>If transaction costs are prohibitive or even sizeable, the arbitrary assignment of rights influences the use of resources and the gain to society.<br>The mere attainment of a contract, therefore, is not a priori evidence of a move toward more efficient use of resources; conversely, the absence of contracting may enhance efficiency.<br>Indeed, even if the costs of private contracting were insignificant, a government might still decide to intervene. Economic analysis has thu far failed to predict the circumstances under which government action will incur lower (or higher) costs than those resulting from private contracting.</li>
<li>Absence of diminishing returns<br>This complication demonstrates not only that alternative assignments of rights may affect resource allocation when the transaction costs are positive, but also that the transaction costs incurred may vary with alternative assignments of rights.</li>
<li>Unlimited property rights / prohibitive transaction costs</li>
</ol>
<p>No hard line seperates limitations of rights which are matters of private contracting from those which fall withinn the jurisdiction of the court or the coercion of government. (Indeed, the very definition of ‘government’ is itself still subject to debate and conjecture.) But whatever government is, its economic role in society must remain unclear until we can pinpoint the activities where governmental intervention incurs lower costs than private contracting.</p>
<p>In specifying the constraints sufficient to yield testable implications for the interpretation of behaviour, two requirements must be met.<br>First, the constraints must be identifiable by observation. Thus, any empirically useful definition of property rights must provide observable situations where changes in rights occur.<br>A second requirement, if property rights are to be useful in economic theorising, is that they be defined in such a way that (given constrained maximisation) changes in behaviour can be derived as a result of changes of rights.</p>
<p>A good or an asset is defined to be private property if, and only if, three distinct sets of rights are associated with its ownership.<br>First, the exclusive right to use (or to decide how to use) the good may be viewed as the right to exclude other individuals from its use.<br>Second is the exclusive right to receive income generated by the use of the good.<br>Third, the full right to transfer, or freely ‘alienate’, its ownership includes the right to enter into contracts and to choose their form.<br>This structure of rights which defines private property is, of course, an idealisation intended for economic theorising; in practice, exclusivity and transferability are matters of degree.</p>
<p>If behaviour is to be interpreted in terms of economic principles, the most basic requirement is that we be able to identify any changing pattern of these rights so that implications can be derived for corresponding changes in contractual behaviour, resource allocation, and income distribution.</p>
<p>In the broadest sense of the term, ‘transaction costs’ comprise those that cannot be conceived to exist in a Crusoe economy.<br>The term then includes not only the costs of forming and enforcing contracts (including seeking information for market transactions), but also the costs of delineating and policing exclusive rights (including those of institutional arrangements such as legislative enactments). This wide definition is essential, for it is difficult (and, insofar as we know, impossible) to separate the cost of exchange from the cost of defining rights to the resource to be exchanged. </p>
<p>A more useful method, of course, is to propose generalised functions of transaction costs which may be systematically applied to a larger number of situations. This task is onerous, as the current state of the art amply demonstrates.</p>
<p>The issue if not divergence itself, but the reliability of the observations used to illustrate it. If to a significant extent these observations are untrue, economists have tried to explain things which do not exist and have formulated policies largely inappropriate for application.</p>
<p>J. L. Buck<br>Contrary to the prevailing opinion that tenants do not farm as well as owners, a classification according to yields by different types of tenure shows no significant variation in yields for most localities, and for the few in which a difference does occur, it is in favour of the tenant or part-owner as often as for the owner…. In some places, even, it is evident that the tenants farm better than the owners.</p>
<p>The lack of significant variation between owner and tenant cultivation in the data presented does not imply that the costs of negotiating and enforcing tenant contracts in China or elsewhere are trivial, or that they will not affect observations in some decisive ways. But, while recognising these transaction costs, we must not jump to the conclusion that tenant farming will be less productive than owner farming.<br>Whether transaction costs will significantly affect behaviour depends upon their impact on resource use at the margin. With or without such costs, maximisation may imply the same marginal equality: namely, for the use of crucial farming resources the marginal return to the input committed equals its marginal opportunity cost.<br>It is true that transaction costs incurred are generally higher with tenant than with owner cultivation, but there is no reason to predict that they are of such proportion or nature that they significantly affect resource use at the crucial margin.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to estimate the standard sets of marginal values which an efficient market is said to equate: the burden of such a task must rest upon those who believe the government can costlessly and accurately make these estimates for the imposition of the ‘ideal’ tax-subsidy schemes.</p>
<p>But any government action can be speciously justified on efficiency grounds by the simple expedient of assuming that transaction costs in the market are high and that costs of governmental control are low.</p>
<p>The common fallacies are that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the constraints assumed have largely been invalid</li>
<li>the observations reported have often been incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p>The thesis here is simply that any valuable application of economic theory must rest upon careful empirical investigation to ensure that the facts are true, that the hypotheses are testable, and that the tests are performed.</p>
<p>Analyses designed to assist policy-making need not be inconsistent with those designed to interpret behaviour.</p>
<p>It is always possible in principle to define (i.e., set up) a system of private rights in property. But in some cases it would still be prohibitively expensive for the owners to police and enforce their rights, given the technical difficulties.</p>
<p>John Burton<br>What conclusions may we draw for public policy?<br>First, the Pigovian policy rule – that externalities necessitate ‘corrective’ government action – is dangerously over-simplistic. It is incorrect as a general rule for efficiency in resource allocation. Its application often leads to a more serious misallocation of resources than that arising from the externalities which government action is supposed to correct.<br>Second the Pigovian analysis contains an implicit bias towards ‘intervention solutions’ for externalities, in the form of taxes, subsidies, regulations and prohibitions.<br>Third, recognition of the fundamental role of attenuations of private property rights in generating externalities leads to consideration of the alternative policy of re-defining property rights. The advantages of this approach are that it harnesses the incentives for individuals, and the relative cheapness of the price system as a means of generating and utilising information, in the interests of conservation.<br>A private property approach is not applicable in all instances, but insufficient attention has been paid in the past to the possibilities of applying it.</p>
<p>The general conclusion for public policy is the classical one:<br>given the inherent defects, complexity, cost and bias of an intervention solution, the general rule should be to let the price system deal with externalities wherever possible: by re-defining property rights and removing barriers to trade due to externalities. Government intervention – domestic or supramational – is best kept as a ‘solution of the last resort’: to be used only when and where high and irreducible transaction costs prevent the internalisation of externalities by private action. Even on these grounds, government intervention must be carefully scrutinised, because the costs and external side effects may outweigh the benefits.<br>The mere existence of externalities thus does not, despite Professor Samuelson, provide ‘a clear case for some kind of public intervention’.</p>

        <p>I have for this purpose defined chronic inflation as a condition in which price increases of more than 20 percent per annum have been typical over an extended period.</p>
<p>Two key lessons flow from Table 1.<br>The first is that there is a close relationship between the rate of inflation and the rate of increase in the money supply.<br>The second is that the rate of monetary expansion tends, even in these chronic inflations, to be greater than the rate of increase of prices.</p>
<p>However, we know too, from common sense and from experience, that inflation operates as a tax on holdings of money. Thus it is also reasonable that the size of real cash balances should be less in an inflationary environment than it would be if there were little or no inflation. This tendency for inflation itself to lead people to economize on their holdings of cash does not show up in the data for chronic inflations. This can be explained in either of two ways.<br>First, people reduce their cash balances in the process of adapting to an inflationary situation. Once they have made their adaption – say by reducing their average bank balance from six weeks’ income to four weeks’ income, they will tend to stay at the new level unless the rate of inflation goes up. Therefore if we observe a country that has an inflation rate of 30 percent per year in the mid-1950s, and continues oscillating around that level into the mid 1960s, we should not expect people to be reducing their real cash holdings in the interim. The reduction would have occurred earlier – in the process of getting from zero or low rates of inflation up to 30 percent.<br>The second reason underlying the observation that the money supply has risen more rapidly than the price level during periods of chronic inflation is simply that the forces of population growth and rising real income levels continue to work even in an inflationary setting. Their effects cumulate through time, and when a long span of years is involved they can easily outweigh the tendency for an increased rate of inflation to cause people to reduce their cash holdings.</p>
<p>Thus we have (1) similarity of rates within each period among the industrial countries, (2) similarity of rates within each period between the selected LDC’s and the industrial countries, and (3) a significant change in the pace of inflation between periods. I believe that one must recognize from these figures the validity of the notion of a ‘world inflation.’ It is not by accident that so many countries have moved, almost in lock-step, through successive, closely similar inflationary experiences. Much more plausible is the idea that they were co-participants in a common process of world inflation.</p>
<p>This interpretation is further strengthened when it is realized that for most of the period under review the bulk of the world was on a system of fixed exchange rates. And just as the cause of inflation in Illinois cannot differ much from that of inflation in Ohio, so long as both states share a common currency and allow goods and services to move freely in and out, so too the cause of inflation in Costa Rica or Iran or the Philippines cannot be very different from that of the ‘world inflation’ so long as they maintain a fixed exchange rate with the major currencies, and so long as they do not introduce dramatic new interferences with the movement of goods and services.</p>
<p>Then in the period since 1973 the major currencies have all floated vis-avis one another, making the notion of a world money supply even more of an abstraction. Yet I still believe that the notion is a good one, generating insights that lead to more fruitful interpretations of reality than the alternative of assuming that each country’s monetary authorities behaved independently. Even though we have ahd nearly five years of floating rates, it is my impression that the monetary authorities of the major countries have behaved with far less independence than the theorists of floating rates are prone to assume. Consequently, in terms of the way the international monetary system has worked since 1973, I would characterize it as a hybrid, functioning if anything more like a fixed-exchange-rate system than like a textbook case of floating rates.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, then, a government intent on borrowing from the banking system at a rate more rapid than that compatible with stable prices, is going to have to expand the money supply at an inflationary pace. This has been the historic source of nearly all chronic and acute inflations.</p>
<p>The reasons why private-sector credit inflations get started (and keep going) are harder to understand than those relating to inflations caused principally by fiscal deficits. Usually there is some entity that has the power to expand credit without being subject to stern control by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The thought is that credit which is for productive purposes is not inflationary, a notion sometimes dubbed ‘the real bills doctrine.’ Plausible though it may appear at first glance, the proposition does not survive close examination. A country’s money supply will typically be equal to something between one and two months’ income. An effort to extend credit equal to even three or four months’ production would be frustrated by inflation, unless the credit came from outside the monetary system. This is so simply because people would not be willing to hold three or four months’ income in the form of money balances.</p>
<p>The rapid rise in international reserves, which started in 1969, stemmed from a variety of causes. The expansion of the supply of United States dollars (which have been for half a century the key currency in the international system) accelerated somewhat under the strains of the Vietnam War. Simutaneously, the world banking system created important new supplies of dollars (Eurodollars) and of some other currencies (German marks, Swiss francs) as it expanded its lending operations denominated in these moneys. Quite independently, but more or less at the same time, there was a significant growth of SDRs (Special Drawing Rights), the new ‘world money’ created within and by the International Monetary Fund to add to the supply of international reserves. Finally, in the mid-1970s there was an expansion of lending by the International Monetary Fund to the Central Banks of its member countries, most of it under the rubric of the IMF Oil Facility, a series of credits advanced to the countries that were hardest hit by the dramatic oil price rise of 1974.</p>
<p>Three effects now enter the picture, all produced by the disequilibrium situation just described:<br>a) People will attempt to reconstitute the shortfall in their real cash balances, simply by spending less than normal for a time. Part of this reduction in spending will fall on purely domestic goods, but part will fall on traded goods, thus inducing a tendency to surplus in the balance of payments and a consequent ‘importation of money.’<br>b) People will also attempt to reconstitute their shortfall of real cash by borrowing. This can be accomplished either through the domestic monetary authorities permitting the expnsion of credit (and money supply), or through borrowing from abroad. If the domestic expansion takes place rapidly enough, this can forestall all the other adjustment mechanisms by itself ‘financing’ a rise of domestic goods prices to match that of traded goods. But to the extent borrowing from abroad is also involved, this second avenue of adjustment also entails an ‘importation of money.’<br>c) Finally, to the extent that neither (a) nor (b) succeeds in rapidly bringing domestic prices into line with world prices, there will be a substitution effect at work, causing people to shift their expenditures away from internationally traded and toward purely domestic goods and services, once again producing an improvement in the balance of payments and an ‘importation of money.’</p>

        <p>The issue is that a rise in the price of any commodity can have two possible interpretations:<br>(a) it can signal a rising relative scarcity or desirability or real cost of that commodity, or<br>(b) it can simply indicate that the commodity in question is being affected by an ongoing process of inflation.<br>For an economy to operate efficiently, economic agents must respond to signals of type (a), producing more of the goods whose relative desirability has increased, using more of the inputs that have become relatively more abundant, and so on.<br>In a world in which the stability of the general level of prices is more or less ensured, economic agents can be sure that the price movements they perceive are essentially type (a) signals. They can therefore respond relatively quickly and recorder their input and output mix in an efficient way.<br>But in a situation of ongoing inflation, there can be considerable uncertainty as to whether any given price movement is of type (a) or type (b).</p>
<p>The consequences for growth are less obvious but probably more important. They stem from the fact that improvements in total factor productivity (TFP) have probably been the most important single source of economic growth, worldwide, at least since the industrial revolution.<br>TFP improvements can be viewed as increases in output per unit of ‘total inputs’ or, equivalently, as reductions in real cost of producing a unit of output. I believe that the latter vision brings greater insight into the growth process, for it leads one to sense how the growth process depends on the success of businessmen and managers in the perpetual search for ways of reducing real production costs (or of making at the same cost a product that has a higher value in the market).<br>In this search, relative prices play an absolutely critical role. If these prices are poorly or mistakenly perceived, fewer ways of reducing real costs will be discovered and implemented, and real economic growth will accordingly be slower.</p>
<p>But, in real-world inflations, individual price adjust at widely different rates – some rapidly, some slowly, some steadily, some in discrete jumps. Thus, even if there were no movements of type (a) at all, or if they were relatively minor, one would observe relative price changes owing to the different speeds and patterns of adjustment of individual prices to an ongoing inflationary process.<br>It is these relative price changes that are confused with those of type (a) and that thereby impede the efficient operation of the economy and slow down growth by slowing the advance of total factor productivity.</p>
<p>The easiest way to obtain a clear understanding of the phenomenon of inflation is by studying the link between money and inflation. People hold money for various purposes, but it is quite correct to say that, whatever the purpose, it is the real value of money that comes into play in serving that purpose.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand the examples presented so far is to assume that no interest is paid on money holdings and that borrowers from banks pay only a modest service charge, perhaps disguised as interest. Under these assumptions, the inflation tax is paid by the holders of M2, the government receives command over the resources released in the case of panel A, and the government and the productive sector share command over the resources released in the case of panel B.</p>
<p>I believe that the magnitude and extent of arbitrary redistribution connected with inflation constitute an additional important reason why governments should make every effort to keep inflation rates low. But I also believe that these redistributions are too complicated, too pervasive throughout the economy, to help us very much as we analyze the process of inflation itself. For that, I believe that the correct monetary magnitude to watch is M2, and that the analysis of changes in M2 should be matched to changes in its counterparts on the asset side of the balance sheet of the consolidated banking system – namely, net foreign assets, bank credit to the government, and bank credit to the productive sector.</p>
<p>At the begining of this paper, I spoke of how inflation impedes the efficient operation of the economy and interferes with economic growth. The causal connection emphasized was the way in which inflation blurs the price signals to which economic agents respond. This blurring of signals impedes the achievement of economic efficiency and hampers the search for innovations that produce economic growth through the reducion of real costs.</p>
<p>Here, I shall focus on a different causal connection, which runs as follows. The higher the rate of inflation, the lower the level of real money balances that people will want to hold. The lower the real money balances (the principal liabilities of the consolidated banking system), the lower the amount of domestic credit that the banking system can extend. Even with constant real credit to the government sector (say in relation to GDP), this will mean that, the higher the rate of inflation, the lower the amount of real credit to the productive sector (again, say, in relation to GDP). Lower credit to the productive sector is likely to affect economic growth directly by reducing that sector’s level of investment. It is also likely to have a negative impact on the efficiency with which the economy operates to the extent that credit, by ‘lubricating’ the economic machine, helps it operate more efficiently. </p>
<p>It can and sometimes does happen that other balance sheet items may be changing through time in such a way as to distort or offset the expected negative relationship between credit variables and the rate of inflation. Three important ways in which this relationship can be offset should be mentioned:<br>(1) net foreign assets may vary substantially (even becoming negative), thus permitting the credit variables to move in a different direction from the monetary variables,<br>(2) the government may turn from being a net recipient of credit from the banking system to being a net lender to it, and<br>(3) the banking system may expand its own capital, and/or may issue long-term bonds, providing it with the means to expand bank credit beyond what would be permitted by the prevailing levels of money and quasi money.<br>None of these variable really destroys the relationships being explored in this section, because changes in the rate of inflation do not by themselves have the effects described in (1)-(3) above. What can happen, however, is that one or another of these effects can occur side by side with an inflation process, thus obscuring empirical regularities of the types shown in the figures.</p>
<p>There is in the history of economic thought an important controversy concerning the relationship between bank credit and inflation. One side of this controversy asserts, with varying caveats and qualifications, that credit expansion is not inflationary as long as the credit is used to finance productive activities. This sums up what is known as the real bills doctrine. It has been shown, time and again, to be false.<br>As is the case with many technical concepts, this doctrine was far more noxious in the hands of politicians, bankers, and businessmen than in the hands of technical economists. The real bills doctrine was music to the ears of these three groups, for it gave a certain legitimacy to massive credit expansion. One simply did not have to worry about possible inflationary consequences, the doctrine said, as long as the credit went to finance productive activities.</p>
<p>Thus, making full allowances for the use of incremental credit to finance new investments, and making a generous allowance for the real productivity of such investments, one still finds that merely financing productive investments is no guarantee against inflation. The right way to think about inflation is in terms of the real cash balances that people are willing to hold. The real bills doctrine is of no use in this process. </p>
<p>Although the real bills doctrine has been the most powerful myth supporting the massive expansion of credit to the productive sector, it is impossible to confirm that the real-world cases of inflations that were principally fueled by credit expansions to the private sector were primarily motivated by this doctrine. However, it is possible to show that such inflations have in fact existed, even though most real-world inflations have stemmed from fiscal deficits.</p>
<p>These examples are anomalies in the history of inflations, but they call attention to the critical role of monetary expansion in creating inflation and to the virtual certainty that any major monetary expansion will have its counterpart somewhere on the asset side of the consolidated banking system’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>The point I would like to make here is that Central American fiscal deficits became significant quite some time before the actual crisis was felt. What happened was that different ways were found to ‘park’ (i.e., ‘place’ or ‘finance’) the deficit in a noninflationary way.<br>A government’s first priority ‘parking place’ for the deficit is probably abroad – by selling instruments of debt to foreigners.<br>Other ways of parking deficits include (1) selling bonds to the social security system; (2) raising the reserve requirements of banks, and permitting (or requiring) them to hold government bonds as part of these reserves; (3) reducing the support that the government gives to public sector enterprises, requiring them to eliminate their own deficits or else cover them through their own borrowing; and (4) passing certain functions (like price supports for agriculture) from the government to the central bank, thus eliminating them as components of the central government’s own deficit.<br>Some of these devices are more cosmetic than real; that is, they ‘hide’ the deficit rather than park it. Yet countries often engage in these activities, which can postpone the time when a given substantial ‘true’ fiscal deficit finally has its full impact on the money supply and hence on the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>I knew from both theory and observation that there was a close causal relation between price inflation on the one hand and monetary expansion on the other. But I also knew from experience that this connection was familiar to those who presided over and ran the central banks of the above countries during the listed episodes. The question then arose of why exaggreated rates of monetary expansion had occurred.<br>In an exercise I called ‘looking beyond the money supply,’ I defined three key variables:<br>β = net increase of banking system credit to the government (public sector) expressed as a fraction of GDP for the period;<br>γ = banking system credit to the public sector as a fraction of total bank credit; and<br>λ  = rate of increase of total (nominal) bank credit.<br>These variables proved to be very useful in discriminating between cases of chronic and acute inflation on the one hand and the cases of the ‘normal’ developing countries on the other, whose experience with price stability was similar to that of the industrial countries.</p>
<p>The following lessons can be drawn from these findings.<br>(1) The government’s borrowing new money from the banking system, if carried beyond a certain point, exposes the country to greater inflation risk, the greater the amount of the borrowing;<br>(2) having a high fraction of outstanding government debt in the total portfolio of the banking system itself exposes the nation to a higher risk of inflation; and<br>(3) increasing the rate of expansion of total bank credit adds to the risk of inflation.</p>
<p>Neither of the above arguments stands up under close examination. I have no quarrel with recognizing that H is, to a certain degree, a direct instrument of central bank policy control, but that does not mean that it should be the principal focus of the central bank authorities, or of those who study and try to assess and interpret central bank policy. The objectives of the central bank incorporate the price level, the level of economic activity, the functioning and solvency of the banking system, the adjustment process whereby the economy seeks and finds its real exchange rate equilibrium, the stability and viability of credit markets, and so on. Looking at the balance sheet of the consolidated banking system brings one much closer to these matters than looking at the mere balance sheet of the central bank.<br>Put another way, M2 may or may not itself be an objective of central bank policy, but even if M2 is looked upon as an instrument, it is an instrument that is much closer to the deeper objectives of central bank policy than is H. My own view is that, if something serious goes wrong at the level of the balance sheet of the consolidated banking system, that is part of the responsibility of the central bank, even though it can operate only indirectly on the components of the consolidated balance sheet. The items on the central bank’s own balance sheet should be looked on mainly as instruments to allow the bank to fulfill its deeper responsibilities.</p>
<p>With such a capital market, increased government demand for loanable funds will lead to a rise in the relevant pattern of interest rates, drawing out additional supplies from the various sources of funds, but also, and very important, displacing demand from the productive sector of the economy. In this process, funds are bid away from the productive sector of the economy, and investment there ends up being lower than it would otherwise be. This process of productive investment being displaced as a consequence of government demand for funds has come to be known as ‘crowding out.’ Quite obviously, the economic growth of a country will suffer to the extent that crowding out takes place.</p>
<p>The degree of crowding out depends greatly on the nature of the rising supply curve of funds from abroad. If it is very elastic, increments in demand for funds will largely be met by new supplies from abroad, and there will be little crowding out. If the curve is very inelastic, and the local supply of loanable funds is also, most of the funds raised by the government will come at the expense of displaced productive investments.</p>
<p>For some countries well integrated into the world capital market, the supply curve of foreign funds has a relatively modest upward slope. In such countries, even when the government does not directly sell its bonds abroad, the sale of bonds in the home market sucks in capital from abroad to such an extent that most of the deficit is effectively financed in this way.</p>
<p>The smaller the degree of integration of a country with the world capital market, the less elastic the supply curve of foreign funds that it faces is likely to be, hence the higher the degree of crowding out caused by government deficits. In the last decade or two, several Latin American countries, most recently Mexico, have experienced real interest rates as high as 2 or 3 percent a month. Such interest rates signal a situation in which the world capital market cannot be counted on as a ready source of incremental supplies of funds.</p>
<p>For those lucky countries that face quite elastic supply curves of foreign funds, crowding out is not an immediate problem. Going into debt now postpones the moment when citizens must ‘pay a price’ for today’s government expenditure. This aspect is always present when the government goes into debt and can easily give rise to deep moral issues connected with passing fiscal burdens on to future generations. So-called populist governments in many different countries have taken the easy road, according benefits to their citizens far beyond their capacity and the citizens’ willingness to pay. Although they can succeed temporarily in this ‘miracle’ simply by accumulating debt, ultimately the price must be paid – a fact that up to now has doomed populist governments to failure.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the course of wisdom and responsibility for governments the world over is to rely as little as possible on deficit financing of any kind. This allows maximum scope for the channeling of the available savings of the economy into productive investments, and it maintains the integrity of government and the society vis-a-vis future generations.</p>

        <p>An economic problem exists whenever scarce means are used to satisfy alternative ends.<br>If the means are not scarce, there is no problem at all; there is Nirvana. If the means are scarce but there is only a single end, the problem of how to use the means is a technological problem. No value judgements enter into its solution; only knowledge of physical and technical relationships.</p>
<p>Knight points out in his Economic Organization, the economic problem may be subdivided into five interrelated problems:<br>1) fixing standards<br>2) organizing production<br>3) distributing the product<br>4) providing for economic maintenance and progress<br>5) adjusting consumption to production over short periods</p>
<p>In a free-enterprise exchange economy this task is accomplished essentially through voting, voting in the market place with dollars.</p>
<p>Prices of products in relation to the costs of producing them determine the distribution of resources among industries; the relative prices of factors, in turn, determine the coordination of factors within industries.</p>
<p>Prices thus serve as guideposts to where resources are wanted most, and, in addition, prices provide the incentive for people to follow these guideposts.</p>
<p>Prices, therefore, do three kinds of things in solving the above firve problems.<br>They transmit information effectively and efficiently;<br>they provide an incentive to users of resources to be guided by this information;<br>and they provide in incentive to owners of resources to follow this information.</p>
<p>There is the problem of over-simplification and the problem that description always sounds like justification.<br>The problem solved by a price system is an extremely complicated one, involving the coordination of the activities of tens and hundreds of millions of people all over the globe and their prompt adjustement to ever-changing conditions.  The price system is an extremely subtle and complex device for solving this problem.<br>Casual observation of the world leads to an underestimation of the complexity of both the problem and the device used to solve it, because insofar as the price system works we are hardly conscious of its workings. The conplexities are brought to our attention only when something goes wrong.<br>Similarly, a summary description necssarily involves over-simplification, emphasis on the highlights and neglect of not unimportant details. </p>
<p>In any normative judgement of the price system on the basis of the preceding description, several things must be kept in mind.<br>First, this description implicitly supposes the existence of effective competition in translating consumer wishes into productive activity. It is assumed that people can affect their incomes only through use of their resources and not through interference with the price system. There is freedom to compete but not freedom to combine.<br>Second, the controlling force is pecuniary demand; voting is in proportion to the number of dollars a person had. This is not obviously ‘just’. The basic inequality, it should be noted, is an inequality in the ownership of resources. What the market does is primarily to determine the return per unit of resource, and there is no reason to believe that the market aggravates the inequality in the ownership of resources.<br>Moreover, any given degree of inequality is a much more serious one in an economy which is governed largely by status or tradition than in a market economy where there is much chance for shifts in the ownership of resources. Historically, the fundamental inequality of economic status has been and is almost certainly greater in economies that do not rely on the free market than in those that do.</p>
<p>The economist has little to say about the formation of wants; this is the province of the psychologist. The econmist’s task is to trace the consequences of any given set of wants.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the word ‘demand’ will be used only when reference is being made to the demand schedule; and the words ‘quantity demanded’ will be used when reference is being make to a particular quantity.</p>
<p>At point A (equalibrium point) the underlying forces of demand and supply, not demand and supply themselves, have established a price which equates the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded.</p>
<p>The more inelastic the demand curve the greater will be the fluctuation in price due to a given change in quantity supplied.</p>
<p>In the shortest of all runs, where conditions are allowed to vary very little, one would expect the demand curve to have the least elasticity. As the range of conditions which are allowed to vary is widened, one would expect the elasticity of the demand curve to increase.</p>
<p>The theoretical explanation offered for the backward bending segment of the supply curve is that a rise in the real wage rate arising from an increased demand for labor has two effects: (1) It makes leisure more expensive, since the cost of an hour of leisure is the wage that could be earned in that hour. This is the substitution effect, and by itself would tend to raise the number of hours worked. (2) If the individual were to work the same number of hours, the rise in the real wage rate increases his real income, which would lead him to want to purchase more of various kinds of goods, including leisure. This is the income effect, and by itself would tend to reduce the number of hours worked unless leisure is an inferior good.</p>
<p>It therefore follows that on the margin everything is equally necessary or equally unnecessary.</p>
<p>The elasticity of demand will depend primarily on the availability of substitutes. Consequently, the more narrowly defined is the comodity in question, the more substitutes will be available and the greater the elasticity of demand for the commodity. Thus the elasticity of demand for white bread is greater than the elasticity of demand for bread.</p>
<p>Consider the following, each of which is sometimes included in ceteris paribus:<br>1) Prices of all other products<br>2) Quantities of all other products<br>3) Money income or money expenditures of consumers</p>
<p>It (‘Walrasian’ function) is an extremely useful abstract conception to bring out the logic of the interrelation of the price system; it cannot be used to analyze a concrete problem.</p>
<p>Diminishing marginal utility will provide a negative slope for the demand curve, but the fact that the demand curve has a negative slope does not require diminishing marginal utility.</p>
<p>The slope of the indifference curve is the rate of substitution in consumption.<br>The slope of the budget line represents the rate of substitution in purchase.<br>This budget line does not necessarily have to be a straight line.</p>
<p>A good is said to be a superior good if the quantity consumed increases as income increases and an inferior good if the quantity consumed decreases as income increases.</p>
<p>Income elasticity is frequently used to define the terms ‘necessities’ and ‘luxuries’. A good is termed a ‘necessity’ if its income elasticity is less than unity, a ‘luxury’ if its income elasticity is greater than unity.</p>

        <p>Theory is valuable, however, in that it allows the development of a set of principles that can be used to untangle the web of different forces involved in social problems. Principles will then develop into a framework for thinking. We might call this way of thinking the economic approach.</p>
<p>Economic theorists make assumptions that simplify a problem and then develop a theoretical model that will yield a testable hypothesis. This hypothesis can then be checked by appealing to the facts.</p>
<p>Most economists would agree that the importance  of assumptions in theory is that they allow the model specified to be logically consistent and to express the fundamental aspects of any social process. For most economists, an important way of judging theory is to consider how well it predicts behavior vis-a-vis alternative theories.</p>
<p>Perhaps our most basic assumption in economics is that people behave in a selfish, self-interested manner.</p>
<p>A short guide to the economic approach</p>
<ol>
<li>Economic theory is positive, or nonnormative; that is, it consists of a set of refutable propositions about ‘what is’ rather than individual, normative value judgments about ‘what ought to be.’</li>
<li>Economic theory cannot predict the future but can only explain the consequences of certain occurrences.</li>
<li>Economists tend to look to private market processes for solutions to social problems.</li>
<li>Economists tend to spend a great deal of effort clarifying options and making the cost of a given choice as clear as possible.</li>
<li>Economists are likely to recognize the opportunity for substitution among options that exists.</li>
<li>A closely related point is that economists employ an incremental or marginal approach.</li>
<li>Economists tend to take an individualistic approach to social analysis; that is, they regard the decisions and behavior of individuals as an important influence on the formulation of public policy and the organization of the economy.</li>
<li>Economic theory is applicable to all economic systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resources of any society, which represent all the inputs that can be used to produce goods and services, are scarce.</p>
<p>The basic institution needed for the market resolution to work is the institution of property rights. Markets and exchange will happen only if individual buyers and sellers possess the property rights to the goods and services they exchange.</p>
<p>Law of demand:<br>The quantity demanded of a good or service is an inverse function of its price, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>The (not quite) law of supply:<br>The quantity supplied of a good or service is usually a positive function of price, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>In other words,<br>demand curves always have a negative slope and<br>supply curves almost always have a positive slope.</p>
<p>The principle of diminishing marginal utility holds that for a given time period, the greater the level of consumption of a particular commondity, the lower the marginal utility.</p>
<p>The word monopoly is derived from the Greek words mono for ‘one’ and poly for ‘seller.’ Monopoly is thus the market structure in which the firm is a single seller of a product that has no close substitutes.</p>
<p>When the demand curve facing monopolist shifts, the profit-maximizing position will shift, so we can’t predict output or price unless we know the exact nature of the shift in demand. In this sense, the monopolist has no supply curve.</p>
<p>Oligopoly, the other form of imperfect competition, is the market structure in which there are few firms. ‘Oligopoly’ comes from the Greek words for ‘few’ and ‘sellers.’ The scarity of sellers is the key to firm behavior in oligopoly.</p>
<p>A license fee on the monopolist will be viewed as a fixed cost and will increase average cost but not marginal cost. In this way, the monopoly profit can be taxed away with no effect on output.</p>
<p>Social Darwinism applied Charles Darwin’s theory of the evolution of the species, often summed up (and simplified) as a belief in the survival of the fittest, to business enterprise. Under that view stronger firms were justified in getting bigger by ‘gobbling up’ the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Regulation of monopoly leads to cost-plus pricing, which destroys cost minimizing incentives. Taxation of monopoly does not destroy these incentives, but it does not change the monopoly price and output.</p>
<p>In bilateral monopoly, a monopolistic seller, the union, sells labor to a monopsony firm. The wage rate will be logically indeterminate, depending on the relative bargaining strengths of the two participants.</p>
<p>The Coase theorem show how externalities are internalized by the assignment of property rights.</p>

        <p>The foundation of political economy and, in general, of every social science, is evidently psychology. A day may come when we shall be able to deduce the laws of social science from the principles of psychology. – Vilfredo Pareto, 1906</p>
<p>The core premise of economic theory is that people choose by optimizing.</p>
<p>This premise of constrained optimization, that is, choosing the best from a limited budget, is combined with the other major workhorse of economic theory, that of equilibrium. In competitive markets where prices are free to move up and down, those prices fluctuate in such a way that supply equals demand.</p>
<p>To simplify somewhat, we can say that<br>Optimization + Equilibrium = Economics<br>This is a powerful combination, nothing that other social sciences can match. </p>
<p>There is, however, a problem: the premises on which economic theory rests are flawed.<br>First, the optimization problems that ordinary people confront are often too hard for them to solve, or even come close to solving.<br>Second, the beliefs upon which people make their choices are not unbiased. Overconfidence may not be in the economists’ dictionary, but it is a well-established feature of human nature, and there are countless other biases that have been documented by psychologists.<br>Third, there are many factors that the optimization model leaves out, as my story about the 137-point exam illustrates. In a world of Econs, there is a long list of things that are supposedly irrelevant. </p>
<p>The good news is that we do not need to throw away everything we know about how economies and markets work. Theories based on the assumption that everyone is an Econ should not be discarded. They remain useful as starting points for more realistic models. And in some special circumstances, such as when the problems people have to solve are easy or when the actors in the economy have the relevant highly specialized skills, then models of Econs may provide a good approximation of what happens in the real world. But as we will see, those situations are the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Moreover, much of what economists do is to collect and analyze data about how markets work, work that is largely done with great care and statistical expertise, and importantly, most of this research does not depend on the assumption that people optimize.</p>
<p>Two research tools that have emerged over the past twenty-five years have greatly expanded economists’ repertorie for learning about the world.<br>The first is the use of randomized control trial experiments, long used in other scientific fields such as medicine. The typical study investigates what happens when some people receive some ‘treatment’ of interest.<br>The second approach is to use either naturally ocurring experiments (such as when some people are enrolled in a program and others are not) or clever econometrics techniques that manage to detect the impact of treatments even though no one deliberately designed the situation for that purpose.</p>
<p>These studies show that one can learn a lot about the world without imposing optimizing models, and in some cases provide credible evidence against which to test such models and see if they match actual human responses.</p>
<p>We don’t have to stop inventing abstract models that describe the behavior of imaginary Econs. We do, however, have to stop assuming that those models are accurate descriptions of behavior, and stop basing policy decisions on such flawed analyses. And we have to start paying attention to those supposedly irrelevant factors, what I will call SIFs for short.</p>
<p>The field has become known as ‘behavioral economics’. It is not a different discipline: it is still economics, but it is economics done with strong injections of good psychology and other social sciences.</p>
<p>The primary reason for adding Humans to economic theories is to improve the accuracy of the predictions made with those theories.</p>
<p>The opportunity cost of some some activity is what you give up by doing it.<br>Giving up the opportunity to sell something does not hurt as much as taking the money out of your wallet to pay for it. Opportunity costs are vague and abstract when compared to handing over actual cash. Paying a surcharge is out of pocket, whereas not receiving a discount is a “mere” opportunity cost.<br>I called this phenomenon the ‘endowment effect’ because, in economists’ lingo, the stuff you own is part of your endowment, and I had stumbled upon a finding that suggested people valued things that were already part of their endowment more highly than things that could be part of their endowment, that were available but not yet owned.</p>
<p>‘Hindsight bias’: the finding is that, after the fact, we think that we always knew the outcome was likely, if not a foregone conclusion.<br>What makes the bias particularly pernicious is that we all recognize this bias in others but not in ourselves.</p>
<p>Judegement under uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.<br>The thesis of the paper was simple and elegant. Humans have limited time and brainpower. As a result, they use simple rules of thumb-heuristics-to help them make judgments.<br>Using these heuristics causes people to make predictable errors. </p>
<p>A forerunner of Kahneman and Tversky was Herbert Simon, a polymath academic who spent most of his career at Carnegie Mellon University. Simon was well known in nearly every field of social science, including economics, political science, artificial intelligence, and organizational theory, but most germane to this book, he wrote about what he called ‘bounded rationality’ well before Kahneman and Tversky came along.<br>In saying that people have bounded rationality, Simon meant that they lack the cognitive ability to solve complex problems, which is obviously true.</p>
<p>In every case, economic theory had a highly specific prediction about some key factor – such as the presence of the cashews or the amount paid for the basketball game tickets – that the theory said should not influence decisions. They were all supposedly irrelevant factors, or SIFs. Much subsequent work in behavioral economics has been to show which SIFs are in fact highly relevant in predicting behavior, often by taking advantages of the systematic biases suggested in Tversky and Kahneman’s 1974 paper.</p>
<p>The fact that we experience diminishing sensitivity to changes away from the status quo captures another basic human trait – one of the earliest findings in psychology – known as the Weber-Fechner Law. The Weber-Fechner Law holds that the just-noticeable difference (JND) in any variable is proportional to the magnitude of that variable.</p>
<p>The reason why people are risk-seeking for losses is the same logic that applies to why they are risk averse for gains.<br>So, we experience life in terms of changes, we feel diminishing sensitivity to both gains and losses, and losses sting more than equivalently sized gains feel good.</p>
<p>The two central concepts of economics remained the same – namely, that agents optimize and markets reach a stable equilibrium – but economists became more sophisticated in their ability to characterize the optimal solutions to problems as well as to determine the conditions under which a market will reach an equilibrium.</p>
<p>Because learning takes practice, we are more likely to get things right at small stakes than at large stakes. This means critics have to decide which argument they want to apply. If learning is crucial, then as the stakes go up, decision-making quality is likely to go down.</p>
<p>I am ususally pretty good about ignoring sunk costs, especailly if the sunk costs are purely monetary in nature. But like most people, if I have put a lot of work into some project I can find it difficult to give it up, even if it is clearly the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Like most aspects of mental accounting, setting up non-fungible budgets is not entirely silly. Be it with mason jars, envelops, or sophisticated financial apps, a household that makes a serious efforts to create a financial plan will have an easier time living within its means.</p>
<p>A good rule to remember is that people who are threatened with big losses and have a chance to break even will be unusually willing to take risks, even if they are normally quite risk averse. Watch out!</p>
<p>To understand the consumption behavior of households, we clearly need to get back to studying Humans rather than Econs. Humans do not have the brains of Einstern (or Barro), nor do they have the self-control of an ascetic Buddhist monk. Rather, they have passions, faulty telescopes, treat various pots of wealth quite diferently, and can be influenced by short-run returns in the stock market. We need a model of these kinds of Humans.</p>
<p>As usual in these cases when demand has suddenl risen, a seller has to trade off short-term gain against possible long-term loss of good will, which can be hard to measure.</p>
<p>But any large first mover who takes ac action that violates the norms of fairness runs considerable risks if competitors do not follow suit.</p>
<p>‘If you gouge them at Christmas they won’t come back in March.’ That remains good advice for any business that is interested in building a loyal clientele.</p>
<p>‘It is incredibly important for any business, no matter how great the demand, not to charge a customer more than the good or service is worth – even if the customer is willing to pay more.’</p>
<p>A large proportion of people can be categorized as conditional cooperators, meaning that they are willing to give their fellow players the benefit of the doubt, but if coopration rates are low, these conditional cooperation cooperators turn into free riders.</p>
<p>Losses are roughly twice as painful as gains are pleasurable, a finding that has been replicated numerous times over the years.</p>
<p>The endowment effect experiments show that people have a tendency to stick with what they have, at least in part because of loss aversion.</p>
<p>Loss aversion and status quo bias will often work together as forces that inhibit change.</p>
<p>It is much easier to detect that we may be in a bubble than it is to say when it will pop, and investors who attempt to make money by timing market turns are rarely successful.</p>
<p>Without the rational framework, there are no anomalies from which we can detect misbehavior. Furthermore, there is not as yet a benchmark behavioral theory of asset prices that could be used as a theoretical underpinning of empirical research. We need some starting point to organize our thoughts on any topic, and the EMH remains the best one we have.</p>
<p>There are definitely anomalies: sometimes the market overreacts, and sometimes it underreacts. But it remains the case that most active money managers fail to beat the market. And as the story about Royal Dutch Shell and LTCM shows, even when investors can know for sure that prices are wrong, these prices can still stay wrong, or even get more wrong. This should rightly scare investors who think they are smart and want to exploit apparent mispricing. It is possible to make money, but it is not easy. Certainly, investors who accept the EMH gospel and invest in low-cost index funds cannot be faulted for that choice.</p>
<p>Instead of expecting mean reversion, people were acting as if what goes up must go up even more.</p>
<p>Five findings from the psychology of decision-making supported our hypothesis that early picks will be too expensive:</p>
<ol>
<li>People are overconfident</li>
<li>People make forecasts that are too extreme</li>
<li>The winner’s curse</li>
<li>The false consensus effect</li>
<li>Present bias</li>
</ol>
<p>A nudge is some smal feature in the environment that attracts out attention and influences behavior.’</p>
<p>If you want people to comply with some norm or rule, it is a good strategy to inform them (if true) that most other people comply.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to encourage someone to do something, make it easy.</li>
<li>We can’t do evidence-based policy without evidence.<br>分享： </li>

        <p>Libertarian paternalism</p>
<p>Improving Decisions about health, wealth, and happiness</p>
<p>Simply by rearranging the cafeteria, Carolyn was able to increase or decrease the consumption of many food items by as much as 25 percent. Carolyn learned a big lesson: school children, like adults, can be greatly influenced by small changes in the context. The influence can be exercised for better or for worse.</p>
<p>A choice architect has the responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions.</p>
<p>As we shall see, small and apparently insignificant details can have major impacts on people’s behavior. A good rule of thumb is to assume that ‘everything matters’.</p>
<p>‘Libertarian paternalism’ is a relatively weak, soft, and nonintrusive type of paternalism because choices are not blocked, fenced off, or significantly burdened.</p>
<p>A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.</p>
<p>Nudges are not mandates.</p>
<p>Hundreds of studies confirm that human forecasts are flawed and biased. Human decision making is not so great either.</p>
<p>For a host of reasons, which we shall explore, people have a strong tendency to go along with the status quo or default option.</p>
<p>Two important lessons can be drawn from this research. First, never underestimate the power of inertia. Second, that power can be harnessed. As we will show, setting default options, and other similar seemingly trivial menu-changing strategies, can have huge effects on outcomes, from increasing savings to improving health care to providing organs for lifesaving transplant operations.</p>
<p>In accordance with our definition, a nudge is any factor that significantly alters the behavior of Humans, even though it would be ignored by Econs.</p>
<p>The false assumption is that almost all people, almost all of the time, make choices that are in their best interest or at the very least are better than the choices that would be made by someone else.</p>
<p>The first misconception is that it is possible to avoid influencing people’s choices. The second misconception is that paternalism always involves coercion.</p>
<p>Automatic system and reflective system</p>
<p>Rules of thumb<br>Their original work identified three heuristics, or rules of thumb – anchoring, availability, and representativeness – and the biases that are associated with each.</p>
<p>Unrealistic optimism is a pervasive feature of human life; it characterizes most people in most social categories. When they overestimate their personal immunity from harm, people may fail to take sensible preventive steps.</p>
<p>People are ‘loss averse’.</p>
<p>The combination of loss aversion with mindless choosing implies that if an option is designated as the ‘default’, it will attract a large market share. Default options thus act as powerful nudges.</p>
<p>Framing works because people tend to be somewhat mindless, passive decision makers. Their reflective system does not do the work that would be required to check and see whether reframing the questions would produce a different answer.</p>
<p>We will call something ‘tempting’ if we consume more of it when hot than when cold.</p>
<p>When self-control problems and mindless choosing are combined, the result is a series of bad outcomes for real people.</p>
<p>Humans are not exactly lemmings, but they are easily influenced by the statements and deeds of others.</p>
<p>Social influences come in two basic categories. The first involves information. The second involves peer pressure.</p>
<p>The moral is that people are paying less attention to you than you believe. If you have a stain on your shirt, don’t worry, they probably won’t notice. But in part because people do think that everyone has their eyes fixed on them, they conform to what they think people expect.</p>
<p>In particular, advertisers are entirely aware of the power of social influences. They try to nudge you by telling you what most people are now doing.</p>
<p>Boomerang effect<br>If you want to nudge people into socially desirable behavior, do not, by any means, let them know that their current actions are better than the social norm.</p>
<p>The ‘mere-measurement effect’ refers to the finding that when people are asked what they intend to do, they become more likely to act in accordance with their answers.</p>
<p>The three social influences that we have emphasized – information, peer pressure, and priming – can easily be enlisted by private and public nudgers.</p>
<p>If you indirectly influence the choices oher people make, you are a choice architect. And since the choices you are influencing are going to be made by Humans, you will want your architecture to reflect a good understanding of how humans behave.</p>
<p>All these forces imply that if, for a given choice, there is a default option – an option that will obtain if the chooser does nothing – then we can expect a large number of people to end up with that option, whether or not it is good for them.</p>
<p>When choices are highly complex, required choosing may not be a good idea; it might not even be feasible.</p>
<p>Humans make mistakes. A well-designed system expects its users to err and is as forgiving as possible. </p>
<p>The best way to help Humans improve their performance is to provide feedback. Well-designed systems tell people when they are doing well and when they are making mistakes.</p>
<p>President Bush told a clubhouse of Florida seniors in 2006, with the plan’s rollout under way: ‘The more choices you have, the more likely it is you’ll be able to find a program that suits your specific needs. In other words, one-size-fits-all is not a consumer-friendly program. And I believe in consumers, I believe in trusting people’.</p>
<p>The more choices there are, and the more complex the situation, the more important it is to have enlightened choices architecture. To produce a user-friendly design, the architect needs to understand how to help Humans.</p>
<p>In this book we have made two major claims. The first is that seemingly small features of social situations can have massive effects on people’s behavior; nudges are everywhere, even if we do not see them. Choice architecture, both good and bad, is pervasive and unavoidable, and it greatly affects our decisions. Choice archetects can preserve freedom of choice while also nudging people in directions that will improve their lives.</p>
<p>The sheer complexity of modern life, and the astounding pace of technological and global change, undermine arguments for rigid mandates or for dogmatic laissez-faire. Emerging developments should strengthen, at once, the principled commitment to freedom of choice and the case for the gentle nudge.</p>

        <p>First, to clear the ground, a brief statement is given of a generally ignored aspect of ‘profit maximization,’ that is, where foresight is uncertain, ‘profit maximization’ is meaningless as a guide to specifiable action.</p>
<p>Adaptive, imitative, and trial-and-error behavior in the pursuit of ‘positive profits’ is utilized rather than its sharp contrast, the pursuit of ‘maximized profits’.</p>
<p>Uncertainty arises from at least two sources: imperfect foresight and human inability to solve complex problems containing a host of variables even when an optimum is definable.</p>
<p>The only way to make ‘profit maximization’ a specifically meaningful action is to postulate a model containing certainty.</p>
<p>This is the criterion by which the economic system selects survivors: those who realizes positive profits are the survivors; those who suffer losses disappear.</p>
<p>Also, the greater the uncertainties of the world, the greater is the possibility that profits would go to venturesome and lucky rather than to logical, careful, fact-gathering individuals.</p>
<p>Among all competitors, those whose particular conditions happen to be the most appropriate of those offered to the economic system for testing and adoption will be ‘selected’ as survivors.</p>
<p>A second element is the ability to adapt one’s self b various methods to an appropriate situation.</p>
<p>Less appropriately acting organisms of the same general class having lower probabilities of survival will find survival difficult.</p>
<p>For example, the long lives and disparate sizes of business firms and hereditary fortunes may seem to be reliable evidence of consistent foresighted motivation and nonrandom behavior.</p>
<p>Thus individual random behavior does not eliminate the likelihood of observing ‘appropriate’ decisions.</p>
<p>Even if environmental conditions cannot be forecast, the economist can compare for given alternative potential situations the types of behavior that would have higher probability of viability or adoption.</p>
<p>Empirical investigations via questionnaire methods, so far used, are incapable of evaluating the validity of marginal productivity analysis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, failure or success often reflects the willingness to depart from rules when conditions have changed; what counts, then, is not only imitative behavior but the willingness to abandon it at the ‘right’ time and cirmstances.</p>
<p>The economic counterparts of genetic heredity, mutations, and natural selection are imitation, innovation, and positive profits.</p>
<p>What really counts is the various actions actually tried, for it is from these that ‘success’ is selected, not from some set of perfect actions.</p>
<p>The formalization of this aproach awaits the marriage of the theory of stochastic processes and economics – two fields of thought admirably suited for union. </p>
<p>It is conjectured that the suggested modification is applicable to a wide class of events and is worth attempts at empirical verification. </p>

        <p>Delegates from forty-four nations met in the New Hampshire resort of Bretton Woods in July 1944 to construct the postwar international economic order.<br>Their objective was to avoid the upheavals of the last years of the Gold Standard and of the Great Depression.<br>They agreed that achieving this goal required:<br>1) fixed, but occasionally adjustable, exchange rates;<br>2) liberalization of international trade but not capital flows;<br>3) enlarged scope for national monetary and fiscal policies;<br>4) and enhanced cooperation through two new international agencies, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (which came to be known as the World Bank).</p>
<p>A central tenet of economics holds that when it comes to the welfare of the poor, direct cash grants are more effective than subsidies on specific consumer goods.</p>
<p>Models are both economics’ strength and its Achilles’ heel; they are also what make economics a science—not a science like quantum physics or molecular biology, but a science nonetheless.</p>
<p>The diversity of models in economics is the necessary counterpart to the flexibility of the social world. Different social settings require different models. Economists are unlikely ever to uncover universal, general-purpose models.</p>
<p>They have to select their models carefully as circumstances change, or as they turn their gaze from one setting to another. They need to learn how to shift among different models more fluidly.</p>
<p>Each of these criticisms derives in large part from a failure to recognize that economics is, in fact, a collection of diverse models that do not have a particular ideological bent or lead to a unique conclusion.</p>
<p>The term “economics” has come to be used in two different ways.<br>One definition focuses on the substantive domain of study; in this interpretation, economics is a social science devoted to understanding how the economy works.<br>The second definition focuses on methods: economics is a way of doing social science, using particular tools. In this interpretation the discipline is associated with an apparatus of formal modeling and statistical analysis rather than particular hypotheses or theories about the economy.</p>
<p>The possibilities of social life are too diverse to be squeezed into unique frameworks. But each economic model is like a partial map that illuminates a fragment of the terrain. Taken together, economists’ models are our best cognitive guide to the endless hills and valleys that constitute social experience.</p>
<p>Training in economics consists essentially of learning a sequence of models. Perhaps the most important determinant of the pecking order in the profession is the ability to develop new models, or use existing models in conjunction with new evidence, to shed light on some aspect of social reality.</p>
<p>For critics, economists’ reliance on models captures almost everything that is wrong with the profession: the reduction of the complexities of social life to a few simplistic relationships, the willingness to make patently untrue assumptions, the obsession with mathematical rigor over realism, the frequent jump from stylized abstraction to policy conclusions.</p>
<p>The Cambridge University economist Ha-Joon Chang says, “95 percent of economics is common sense—made to look difficult, with the use of jargons and mathematics.”</p>
<p>In truth, simple models of the type that economists construct are absolutely essential to understanding the workings of society. Their simplicity, formalism, and neglect of many facets of the real world are precisely what make them valuable. These are a feature, not a bug.<br>What makes a model useful is that it captures an aspect of reality. What makes it indispensable, when used well, is that it captures the most relevant aspect of reality in a given context.</p>
<p>When models are selected judiciously, they are a source of illumination. When used dogmatically, they lead to hubris and errors in policy.</p>
<p>A model focuses on particular causes and seeks to show how they work their effects through the system. A modeler builds an artificial world that reveals certain types of connections among the parts of the whole—connections that might be hard to discern if you were looking at the real world in its welter of complexity.</p>
<p>Models do more than warn us that results could go either way. They are useful because they tell us precisely what the likely outcomes depend on.</p>
<p>This is the distinction that philosophers of science refer to as internal versus external validity.<br>A well-designed experiment that successfully traces out cause and effect in a specific setting is said to have a high degree of “internal validity.” But its “external validity” depends on whether its conclusion can travel successfully outside the experimental context to other settings.</p>
<p> Sound extrapolation in turn requires a combination of good judgment, evidence from other sources, and structured reasoning. The power of all these types of experiments is that they teach us something about the world outside the context in which they’re carried out, on account of our ability to discern similarity and draw parallels across diverse settings.</p>
<p>Simplification and abstraction necessarily require that many elements remain counterfactual in the sense that they violate reality. What is the best way to think about this lack of realism?</p>
<p>Economic models consist of clearly stated assumptions and behavioral mechanisms. As such, they lend themselves to the language of mathematics.</p>
<p>Math essentially plays two roles in economics, neither of which is cause for glory: clarity and consistency.<br>First, math ensures that the elements of a model—the assumptions, behavioral mechanisms, and main results—are stated clearly and are transparent. Once a model is stated in mathematical form, what it says or does is obvious to all who can read it.<br>The second virtue of mathematics is that it ensures the internal consistency of a model—simply put, that the conclusions follow from the assumptions. This is a mundane but indispensable contribution.</p>
<p>Verbal arguments that seem intuitive often collapse, or are revealed to be incomplete, under closer mathematical scrutiny. The reason is that “verbal models” can ignore nonobvious but potentially significant interactions.</p>
<p>Some branches of economics, such as mathematical economics, have come to look more like applied mathematics than like any kind of social science. Their reference point has become other mathematical models instead of the real world.</p>
<p>The good news is that, contrary to common perception, math for its own sake does not get you far in the economics profession. What’s valued is “smarts”: the ability to shed new light on an old topic, make an intractable problem soluble, or devise an ingenious new empirical approach to a substantive question. In fact, the emphasis on mathematical methods in economics is long past its peak.<br>Today, models that are empirically oriented or policy relevant are greatly preferred in top journals over purely theoretical, mathematical exercises. The profession’s stars and most heavily cited economists are those who have shed light on important public problems, such as poverty, public finance, economic growth, and financial crises—not its mathematical wizards</p>
<p>Despite the math, economic models tend to be simple. For the most part, they can be solved using pen and paper.</p>
<p>“Big data gives us a chance to view society in all its complexity,” writes one of the leading proponents of this view. This would send our traditional economic models the way of the horse and buggy.</p>
<p>As Watts notes, disturbances in one part of the economy—say, in mortgage finance —can be amplified and produce major shocks for the entire economy, as in the “butterfly effect” from chaos theory.</p>
<p>In some settings, a simple model can be, well, too simple. We may need more detail. The trick is to isolate just the interactions that are hypothesized to matter, but no more.</p>
<p>Economic models are relevant and teach us about the world because they are simple. Relevance does not require complexity, and complexity may impede relevance. Simple models —in the plural—are indispensable. Models are never true; but there is truth in models. We can understand the world only by simplifying it.</p>

        <p>社会科学对于因果关系的关注使得倾向值匹配( propensity score matching) 的方法受到越来越多的重视。</p>
<p>本文从以下几个方面对这一方法进 行述评。<br>首先，本文系统梳理了倾向值匹配方法的历史、发展及其对于社会 学调查研究的意义。<br>其次，通过一个具体实例，本文展示了倾向值匹配的具 体实施过程。<br>第三，从密尔对因果关系的论述以及统计学的反事实框架 ( counterfactual framework) 出发，本文阐释了倾向值匹配如何通过“控制”混 淆变量从而满足非混淆假设( unconfoundedness) 来帮助研究者提出因果性结 论。<br>第四，本文将倾向值匹配与回归中断设计和工具变量进行了比较。<br>最 后，在简要分析倾向值匹配的局限性之后，本文讨论了倾向值匹配的最新发 展趋势。</p>
<p>倾向值指被研究的个体在控制 可观测到的混淆变量( confounding variables) 的情况下受到某种自变量 影响的条件概率。在一般的实证研究中，由于存在很多其他变量混淆 自变量和因变量之间的关系，研究者很难直接探索二者之间的“净效 果”( net effects) 。。这些 混淆变量的影响通常被称为选择性误差( selection bias) ，而通过倾向值 匹配的方式来控制和消除选择性误差则是罗森鲍姆和鲁宾论文的题中 之义。罗森鲍姆和鲁宾用数理方法证明: 通过将这些混淆变量纳入 Logistic 回归模型来产生一个预测个体受到自变量影响的概率( 倾向 值) ，研究者可以通过控制倾向值来遏制选择性误差对研究结论的影 响从而保证因果结论的可靠性。</p>
<p>在各种控制倾向值的方法中，匹配( matching) 比较简便易行。其 基本逻辑是将受到自变量影响的个体与没有受到影响的个体进行配 对。</p>
<p>在得到倾向值之后，罗森鲍姆和鲁宾提出了多种 控制 倾 向 值 的 方 法: 除 了 匹 配 之 外，也可以将倾向值分层 ( stratification) 或细分( sub-classification) ，然后在每个层次或类别内探 索因果关系; 或者也可以将倾向值作为新的变量进行回归分析。① 而 在赫克曼的计量经济学传统中，倾向值主要是作为一个新的变量被纳 入到已有的计量经济模型中，例如选择模型( selection model) ，工具变 量( instrumental variable) ，或 双 重 差 分 方 法 ( difference-in-differences method) 。需要指出的是，这种差异只是在处理倾向值的具体方式上的 不同，本质上这两个传统的基本逻辑是一致的，即在考察自变量效果之 前通过模型估计并控制个体受到自变量影响的概率。</p>
<p>基于调查资料的 研究 也 被 称 为“观 察 性 研 究”( observational studies) ( Rosenbaum， 2002) 。在实验性研究中，选择性误差可以通过随机化( randomization) 的方法来克服，但在观察性研究中，类似的随机化是不可能的。</p>
<p>对于这种选择性误差，我们 可以通过赫克曼误差修正模型( selection correction model) 来进行控制， 但这个模型实施起来较为复杂。相比而言，倾向值匹配为我们提供了 一种更为直观简便的处理选择性误差的方法。</p>
<p>倾向值匹配通常配合敏感性分析( sensitivity analysis) 来检验我们在 预测倾向值时是否忽略了某些关键的混淆变量。</p>
<p>当我们谈及因果性的时候，我们往往会回归到 密尔对求同法( method of agreement) 及求异法 ( method of differences) 的讨论。</p>
<p>从“控制”的角度出发，倾向值匹配十分巧妙地完成了对多个混淆 变量的控制。</p>
<p>倾向值匹配的办法 巧妙地解决了这个多混淆变量下的“多维”( multiple dimensional) 问 题: 它不再关注每个需要控制的混淆变量的具体取值，而是转而关注将 这些变量纳入 Logistic 回归方程后预测出来的倾向值取值。只要保证 倾向值匹配，这些所有需要控制的混淆变量就都考虑到了( Rosenbaum ＆ Rubin，1983) 。这样做实际上是将对多个混淆变量的控制转为对倾 向值的控制从而达到“降维”( dimension reduction) 的目的。换句话说， 无论有多少需要控制的混淆变量，我们都能够通过倾向值匹配的方法 将它们控制，从而帮助我们得出因果性结论。因此，从“控制”的角度 出发，倾向值匹配法很好地解决了多混淆变量时的控制问题，从而支持 了因果推论。</p>
<p>反事实框架( counterfactual framework)</p>
<p>这在 统计学上称为“非混淆假设”( unconfoundedness assumption)</p>
<p>“回归中断设计”( regression discontinuity design)，回归中断设计 中只有一个混淆变量 x。</p>
<p>工具变量( instrumental variable)，利用工具变量进行因果推论需要满 足很多假设条件( Imbens ＆ Angrist，1994) 。<br>第一个假设称为“单位实验效果值稳定假设”( stable unit treatment value assumption) 。<br> 第二个假设就是上面提到的非混淆假设，即抽签的结 果和个体的健康之间相互独立。由于这里是随机抽签，因此这一条件 得到满足。<br>第三个假设是“排除性假设”( exclusion restriction) 。这一 假设意味着在因果推论中排除两类人。第一类人是无论抽签结果如何 都会服兵役( 总是服兵役的人) ，而第二类人是无论抽签结果如何都不 会服兵役( 总是不服兵役的人) 。<br>第四个假设是“平均因果效果非 零”( nonzero average causal effect) ，即保证如果抽中的号码小，则服兵 役的概率就高。<br>最后一个假设是“单调性”( monotonicity) ，意味着抽 中小数字的人去服兵役的概率要比抽中大数字的人去服兵役的概率 高。 根据这一假设，那些“低数字偏偏不服兵役”而“高数字偏偏服兵 役”的“叛逆者”就被排除在外了。</p>
<p>任何统计方法都有其自身的局限性，倾向值匹配也不例外。<br>首先， 在社会学研究中，非混淆假定往往难以满足。正因为如此，很多研究会明确说明其结论有效性的前提是非混淆假设成立，如果假设不成立，结论也会相应受到 质疑( Brand ＆ Xie，2010) 。<br>其次，倾向值匹配假定个体之间不存在相互影响，即“单位实验效 果值稳定假设”。该假设也同样会在社会学研究中受到质疑。 在利用倾向值匹配去研究组织结构时，研究者需要十分注意这一假设。<br>第三，除上述基本假设之外，倾向值匹配并不考虑变量之间的交互 作用而只是关注某个我们关心的自变量的效果，同时和多元回归一样， 倾向值匹配也会受到忽略变量( omitted variables) 问题的影响。<br>此外， 目前主流统计软件分析的自变量是二分变量( 例如上不上大学) ，而对 连续型自变量的探讨还很不成熟。 总体而言，倾向值匹配方法主要应用于效果评估研究中 ( evaluation) 。例如上述大学教育对收入的影响以及摩根研究的天主教学校 对学生成绩的影响等等。<br>这类问题的一个共同点在于我们在分析数据 之前已经预先知道一个二分型的变量对于另外一个变量有因果效应。 此外，对那些影响二分变量的混淆变量，我们也应该具有比较清楚的理 论支持。在这种情况下，倾向值匹配会比较适用。然而，如果我们对谁 “影响”谁不是十分清晰( 例如互为因果) ，或者对于我们需要考虑哪些 混淆变量也不了解的话，倾向值匹配就很有可能违反上面提及的前提 假设，从而使我们的结论受到质疑。</p>
<p>完全匹配方法( full matching) 可以提高样本的利用率从而保证每个个体都能在匹配过程中被 使用到 ( Hansen，2004; Stuart ＆ Green，2008 ) 。<br>遗 传 性 匹 配 ( genetic matching) 则利用人工智能的方法提高匹配效率，其过程甚至不需要计算具体的倾向值( Sekhon ＆ Mebane，1998) 。<br>其 次，倾向值匹配方法的另一个发展趋势在于对更多研究情景的考虑。 例如，新的技术开始被开发出来以考察如何将倾向值匹配应用于自变 量是连续型的情况( Hirano ＆ Imbens，2004) ，或自变量超过两个取值水 平的情况( Lechner ＆ Miquel，2005) 。<br>最后，倾向值匹配和现有统计模 型和统计技术也越来越多地结合起来。这方面已有的探索包括将倾向 值匹配和分层模型结合起来考察因果效果在不同群体中体现出的异质 性( Brand，2010; Brand ＆ Davis，2011; Brand ＆ Xie，2010) ，以及利用贝 叶斯方法考察倾向值计算的不确定性( An，2010) 。<br>这三个发展趋势预 示着倾向值匹配方法会在未来一段时间有更大的飞跃。</p>
