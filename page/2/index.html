        <p>Institutions are defined as formal and informal rules that constrain individual behavior and shape human interaction; the institutional environment varies with a person’s position in society (North 1990).</p>
<p>The economics of institutions employs the term property rights in a general sense (which does not correspond to its role in legal theory) to define the rights of an actor to use valuable assets (Alchian 1965). The property rights of an actor are embodied both in formal rules and in social norms and customs, and their economic relevance depends on how well the rights are recognized and enforced by other members of society. It is important to note that the ability (power) of an actor to use valuable resources derives both from external/exogenous control and from internal/endogenous control. External control depends on the property rights of an actor or, in other words, on how his or her institutional environment – constitutions, statutes, regulations, norms, enforcement, and sanctions – constraints and directs both the actor in question and outsiders. Internal control is established by the actors themselves through various investments aimed at gaining control over scarce resources, involving monitoring, fencing, hiring private guards, checking reputations, and other measures.</p>
<p>The term transaction costs refers to an actor’s opportunity cost of establishing and maintaining internal control of resources. Transaction costs, the costs of measurement and enforcement, are incurred to protect values both in voluntary exchange and against involuntary exchange, such as theft.</p>
<p>Finally, the term organization refers to a set of actors who cooperate or act jointly in production (North 1990).</p>
<p>The first level of analysis attempts to explain how variations in institutional arrangements affect economic outcomes or wealth; and for this purpose institutions, organizations, and contractual arrangements are treated as exogenous variables.</p>
<p>The second analytical level attempts to explain how the institutional framework affects the structure of economic organizations and contractual arrangements.</p>
<p>The third level of analysis, which opens a vast panorama of miscellaneous research, attempts to explain various elements of the institutional framework and the structure of property rights. As the institutional framework consists of formal and informal rules and their enforcement, research at this level intrudes into the domain of political science, sociology, and anthropology, along with law and history. Consequently, the usefulness of the amended neoclassical model is more in question at this level than at the other two, at least for certain research topics.</p>
<p>Formal rules are only a part of the story. We are concerned with both institutions and their enforcement characteristics, and enforcement depends heavily on informal rules, such as norms, customs, and conventions (North 1990). Arrow (1990: I39) has made the sensible observation that an economic system based on specialization and extensive contracting will not function properly unless the trading parties are imbued with commercial morality.</p>
<p>It is commonly believed that informal institutions, such as norms and customs, change relatively slowly, and therefore, in studies involving marginal changes in formal rules, informal institutions can often be taken for granted. Yet changes in informal institutions must be considered in studies with a long time horizon or studies of large-scale changes in economic systems, such as the evolution of efficient market economies in Northwestern Europe or the transition to markets of the former Soviet-type economies.</p>
<p>Finally, we must recognize the limits of our approach. Altough various regularities and patterns have been and will be uncovered, we should not expect to discover a deterministic law of economic systems and economic history. Although the growth rate of an economy depends on various stocks, such as the stocks of institutions and knowledge, physical and human capital, and natural resources, economic prosperity also depends on external events, accidental circumstances, and apparently unpredictable political events and policies.</p>
<p>To conclude, the economics of institutions recognizes that individuals seek to better their position not only by investing in economic activity within a given framework of institutions, but also, in the long run, by investing in strengthening their property rights through altering the institutional framework. Far from failing to recongnize the importance of self-interest and power, many economists studying institutional change may have gone too far by modeling the behavior of actors solely in terms of unadulterated self-interest. Not all behavior in the political sphere can be explained satisfactorily in terms of pure self-interest. Obviously, humans are also motivated by considerations such as altruism and ideologies that stress values other than narrow self-interest, which brings us to the topic of rational choice.</p>
<p>We make four points about the use of rational choice analysis in the economics of institutions. The first point is the simple assertion that rational choice analysis is the best general method we know for modeling behavior at various analytical levels in the economics of institutions.</p>
<p>The second point is that the economics of institutions has widened the narrow rational choice model of neoclassical economics by adjusting for transaction costs, which can be done by modifying either the constraints of individual actors or the choice process itself.</p>
<p>The third point is that the rational choice model is more general than is often recognized. The rational choice approach only involves the assumption that individuals act consistently with their preferences when faced with alternative opportunity sets.</p>
<p>The fourth and final point is that we recognize the inadequacy of the rational choice model, with its traditional assumption of stable preferences, in exploring certain important aspects of the economics of institutions, particularly the emergence, maintenance, and decay of social norms and other informal institutions (North 1990, 1993).</p>
<p>Informal institutions appear to be closely related to people’s views of the world, both their moral views and their views of causal relationships. Changes in informal institutions are presumably related to learning, although people seem to draw different conclusions from the same experience, since they are subject to path dependence, just as social scientists hold divergent views of the same observable phenomena (Eggertsson 1993; North 1993). Furthermore, in many instances, people’s experience provides inclusive evidence for rejecting their theories.</p>
<p>The issue of mental models opens up a range of fascinating issues. It is clear that investigators in this field have asked the right question, but so far the ‘right’ answer or operational models of general use have eluded investigators. The area is an important frontier of research and of great interest to all social scientists. It is conceivable that future scholars studying the economics of institutions will use models of the individual of various degrees of sophistication, depending on the nature of their work. For some purposes the narrow neoclassical rational choice model might be appropriate, for other uses the bounded rationality/transaction costs models, and in yet other situations models involving learning. It is interesting to contemplate whether future theories of the origins and evolution of mental models will be formulated in terms of purposive behavior and rational choice. One solution might involve two levels, an exotic theory explaining the emergence of mental models and another theory of the more conventional rational choice variety explaining actions in terms of given mental models.</p>
