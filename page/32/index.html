        <p>One measure of the ‘pressure’ that is put on the banking system by the need to finance the government is<br>β = (Δbanking system credit to the public sector) / GDP<br>The data on banking system credit to the public sector are derived from the consolidated accounts of the banking system, as given in the monetary survey of International Financial Statistics (IFS). In calculating β, the increase in these items over the course of a year (i.e., from December to December) is expressed as a fraction of the nominal GDP of that year, β is thus the fraction of total GDP that the public sector siphons out of the banking system.</p>
<p>A second measure of the pressure put on the banking system by the government is<br>γ = (banking system credit to the public sector) / (total bank credit)<br>Where β is a flow variable reflecting concurrent action by the public sector, γ deals with stocks and reflects the cumulative result of past actions.</p>
<p>Note that neither β nor γ alone has any direct mechanical connection to the increase in the money supply. As already shown, it is possible up to a point for the government to borrow from the banking system without the latter, in turn, increasing the money supply (M). But under a typical inflationary scenario we would expect that a high β would sooner or later lead to increases in M, especially when γ is itself already relatively high.</p>
<p>The choice of the third variable was similarly governed by a desire to avoid a ‘money supply identity.’ That variable is<br>λ = (Δbanking credit during year t) / (total bank credit at end of (t-1))<br>Obviously, there is more of a connection between the rate of increase in money (μ) and λ than between μ and β or γ, for domestic credit is usually the largest single item on the asset side of the banking system’s consolidated balance sheet, while money is the largest single item on the liability side.</p>
<p>Thus one can at least say that the volume of credit is a policy variable and that it is distinct from the quantity of money. The volume of credit retains its identity as a policy variable even when the quantity of money is beyond the control of the Central Bank, as in a fixed exchange rate system, or one with a pre-fixed crawling peg. Nonetheless, when the rate of inflation gets to be high, it is most often driven by the domestic credit component of the asset side. (Only in rare cases does one witness a major price inflation that is simply fueled by a huge inflow of reserves.)</p>
<p>The annual average rate of inflation reported in IFS is the average level of the consumer price index (CPI) for one year minus the same index for the previous year.</p>
<p>Table 12.2 summarizes the results of the comparison of chronic and acute inflations with each other and with the control group. The picture emerging from this table is exceedingly clear. Inflationary countries siphon more resources out of their banking systems to finance their public sectors than do noninflationary countries Similarly, countries where the inflation disease is acute do so in a more exaggerated way than do countries where the disease take on the more sustainable ‘chronic’ form.</p>
<p>This confirms another conclusion from earlier work: that the basic policy stance of the exchange rate crisis countries seems to exhibit greater willingness to run inflation risks than is the case in the stable countries. This was found to be true in terms of the distributions of the ratio of international reserves (R) to domestic credit (D) of the banking system, where the devaluation crisis countries kept systematically lower international reserves (even in noncrisis years) than did the successful countries. It was also true that in the successful countries, policies of defending international reserves (by reducing credit when international reserves were falling) were triggered at higher levels of [R/(R+D)] than was the case for the crisis countries. Finally, a much higher fraction of the stable countries shifted to a reserve-defending monetary policy when international reserves fell into operationally defined danger zones.<br>In short, the evidence examined in earlier work led to the conclusion that the countries that ended up having devaluation crises played riskier policy games than the stable countries, even in years when no crisis was impending.</p>
<p>I am very troubled by the amount of work I seen using cross-country regression analysis. To me, the ideal regression equation is a behavior or technical relation – like the demand for sugar, the supply of wheat, or the production function for cigarettes. These relations typically hold for given sets of demanders, of farmers, of producers. Even here we often have to allow for changes in tastes and technology, but on the whole we can point to a fair number of more than modest successes with the time-series analysis of behavior relations.</p>
<p>As we move away from demand and supply relations to policy relations, I am already worried, even by time-series analysis following the history of a particular country. Why? Because I have watched too many changes of government, even of key ministers within a given government, which have entailed very major changes in policy behavior – in terms of the objectives pursued, the instruments used, and the manners of use of given instruments. So I am even leery of doing time-series regressions explaining policy behavior for a single country, except where I feel that there was substantial continuity of the same basic policy processes and norms.</p>
<p>You can imagine how much worse I feel about a cross-section regression that throws into the same hopper the policymakers of Switzerland and Iceland, of Indonesia and India, of Argentina and Australia, of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, and of Burma and Thailand. I do not believe for a minute that the same regression could summarize the policy behavior of all these countries, or even of the two countries that constitute each of the listed pairs. </p>
<p>But lots of cross-country policy regressions do throw together, hence imputing similar behavior patterns to, countries as dissimilar as these. I find that to be of the same order of mistake as, say, lumping India and Pakistan together in a cross-section study of the demand for beef. In fact, most cross-sectional policy regressions are easy to pull apart. Where good R2 are present, they are usually determined by a few outlier observations. Get rid of the outliers, and what remains is usually a shapeless blob of data points.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Be wary of policy regressions over time, even in a single country. Be doubly or triply wary of regressions that in effect presume the existence of similar behavior parameters across countries.</p>
<p>Nature have been more insidious, more cruel, in providing the temptation without a ready and clear perception of the risk.</p>
<p>So it is with the policies that lead to inflation. Financing government deficits by the banking system (β) feels good to begin with; so also does generalized credit expansion (λ). Increasing the share of total bank credit going to the government (γ) may also be a temporary palliative, though in the end a high γ, like semimentary rock, imbeds in layers the record of successive policy erosion in the past.</p>
<p>Policymakers, like individuals, are often tempted to follow the path of least resistence – the easy way. When they do so, it is easy for them to select out precedents where one country or another followed this path with apparent impunity. The connection between risky or ‘wrong’ policies and their consequences is, unfortunately, probabilistic rather than mechanical, and the probability distributions of the outcomes of bad and better policies have the unfortunate habit of overlapping. The are not disjoint.</p>
<p>In particular, I do not want to assert that reducing inflation from 10% to 0% comes without important costs of the type traditionally implied. But there is no doubt concerning the lessons of experience that in actual fact disinflation from peaks of 80,90,100% and more have, on the whole, been accompanied by greater prosperity. It is here, in this subset of our experience, that one finds it hard to document the traditional view of the ‘high cost of disinflation’.</p>
