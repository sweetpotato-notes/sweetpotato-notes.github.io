        <p>Our general conclusion must be that in the field of economic progress the notion of tendency towards equilibrium is definitely inapplicable to particular elements of growth and with reference to progress as a unitary process or system of interconnected changes is of such limited and partial application as to be misleading rather than useful. (Knight, 1935)</p>
<p>There are three themes to this chapter that follow from its evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>The first is that capitalist economies grow as they develop, so that growth cannot be treated meaningfully by a concept of uniform expansion in which all the components of an economy expand at the same proportionate rate. Balanced growth is a chimera, it is the heterogeneity of growth rates within the economy that needs to be explained, and differential rates of growth lead us directly to structural change and development. It follows that an aggregate rate of growth or an aggregate ratio has no more substance than the individual components from which it is constructed by the observer. Indeed, even in a multi-sector economy, there may be no activity that grows at the aggregate, average rate. Consequently, the evolutionary modes of explanation used below are essentially statistical in nature and relate to changes in population ensembles.</p>
<p>Second, as the epigraph to this chapter indicates, growth is not an equilibrium process and cannot be if it is knowledge based, for what sense is there in the idea that the growth of knowledge is an equilibrium process? Yet the possibility of evolution depends on order and on the organising processes that generate coherent structures of economic activity, whether in firms, in markets or in other organisational forms that sit within the wider set of evolved and instituted rules of the game (Abramovitz, 1989; Nelson, 2005). Thus there is a paradox at the centre of capitalism: the presence of order depends on stabilising forces that give coherence and durability to patterns of organisation, but the development of the system requires that the prevailing order is open to invasion by economic novelty, and to this degree it is marked by instability. It is the inherent openness of the market system to the challenge contained in novel economic conjectures, its capacity to stimulate and resolve disagreement about better ways to allocate resources and meet changing needs, which gives innovation and the entrepreneur such a powerful role to play in evolutionary growth theory. This is Schumperter’s argument but it was surely also Marshall’s point when he identified knowledge and organisation as ‘our most powerful engine of production’ (1920, p. 138). </p>
<p>Third, like Nelson and Winter (1982), we believe that aggregate explanations of economic growth should be compatible with the vast diversity of micro level, historical evidence concerning the events and processes that equate to the notions of ‘innovation’ and ‘enterprise’. Technical progress has measurable aggregate effects but it is not generated by any aggregate process. Thus, any respectable evolutionary explanation of growth should connect to the rich literatures that study innovation and its management, the history of technology and business organization, and the developing capabilities of firms and other institutions that jointly influence the growth and application of knowledge. These literatures are natural complements to an evolutionary theory of economic growth; they frame our understanding of the processes generating and limiting innovation, and they provide countless empirical examples to shape our thinking on the knowledge-growth connection.</p>
<p>Several formal consequences follow that differentiate an evolutionary account from modern equilibrium growth theory, endogenous or otherwise.<br>First, we make no appeal to the representative agent, or more accurately described ‘the uniform agent’. What is statistically representative cannot be chosen on a priori grounds. Rather, representative action is an emergent, developing consequence of the economic process, and no evolutionary theory can operate by eliminating diversity in economic behaviour. Indeed, our whole scheme generates growth because of non-representative behaviour.<br>Second, while our economy is competitive, we do not mean by this a state of perfect competition but rather a process of competition within and between industries, the grand themes of Marshallian flux and Schumpeterian enterprise. The importance of competition is not to be understood narrowly, in terms of optimal resource allocation but, broadly, in terms of the connection between technical progress and the widespread diffusion of gains in real income through reductions in the prices of goods and services.<br>Finally, we make no sharp separation between factor substitution within a given technique and changes in technique, for the two phenomena are inseparable. All change in methods requires some new understanding that is only obtained by investing resources in problem-solving activities. In part this is because we do not accept the neoclassical production function as a frame of analysis (Bliss, 1975; Harcourt, 1972), but more fundamentally it is  because we do not reason in terms of aggregate stocks of knowledge. There is no metric to reduce knowledge and its changes to a meaningful real aggregate, and the attempt to construct such an aggregate serves only to disguise the role of new knowledge in the process of development.</p>
<p>We may summarise our perspective quite sharply. What distinguishes modern capitalism is not only its order-imposing properties that lead to the self-organisation of the economy, but also the self-transforming properties that create wealth from knowledge and in so doing induce the further development of useful knowledge.</p>
