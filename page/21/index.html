        <p>Theory is valuable, however, in that it allows the development of a set of principles that can be used to untangle the web of different forces involved in social problems. Principles will then develop into a framework for thinking. We might call this way of thinking the economic approach.</p>
<p>Economic theorists make assumptions that simplify a problem and then develop a theoretical model that will yield a testable hypothesis. This hypothesis can then be checked by appealing to the facts.</p>
<p>Most economists would agree that the importance  of assumptions in theory is that they allow the model specified to be logically consistent and to express the fundamental aspects of any social process. For most economists, an important way of judging theory is to consider how well it predicts behavior vis-a-vis alternative theories.</p>
<p>Perhaps our most basic assumption in economics is that people behave in a selfish, self-interested manner.</p>
<p>A short guide to the economic approach</p>
<ol>
<li>Economic theory is positive, or nonnormative; that is, it consists of a set of refutable propositions about ‘what is’ rather than individual, normative value judgments about ‘what ought to be.’</li>
<li>Economic theory cannot predict the future but can only explain the consequences of certain occurrences.</li>
<li>Economists tend to look to private market processes for solutions to social problems.</li>
<li>Economists tend to spend a great deal of effort clarifying options and making the cost of a given choice as clear as possible.</li>
<li>Economists are likely to recognize the opportunity for substitution among options that exists.</li>
<li>A closely related point is that economists employ an incremental or marginal approach.</li>
<li>Economists tend to take an individualistic approach to social analysis; that is, they regard the decisions and behavior of individuals as an important influence on the formulation of public policy and the organization of the economy.</li>
<li>Economic theory is applicable to all economic systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resources of any society, which represent all the inputs that can be used to produce goods and services, are scarce.</p>
<p>The basic institution needed for the market resolution to work is the institution of property rights. Markets and exchange will happen only if individual buyers and sellers possess the property rights to the goods and services they exchange.</p>
<p>Law of demand:<br>The quantity demanded of a good or service is an inverse function of its price, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>The (not quite) law of supply:<br>The quantity supplied of a good or service is usually a positive function of price, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>In other words,<br>demand curves always have a negative slope and<br>supply curves almost always have a positive slope.</p>
<p>The principle of diminishing marginal utility holds that for a given time period, the greater the level of consumption of a particular commondity, the lower the marginal utility.</p>
<p>The word monopoly is derived from the Greek words mono for ‘one’ and poly for ‘seller.’ Monopoly is thus the market structure in which the firm is a single seller of a product that has no close substitutes.</p>
<p>When the demand curve facing monopolist shifts, the profit-maximizing position will shift, so we can’t predict output or price unless we know the exact nature of the shift in demand. In this sense, the monopolist has no supply curve.</p>
<p>Oligopoly, the other form of imperfect competition, is the market structure in which there are few firms. ‘Oligopoly’ comes from the Greek words for ‘few’ and ‘sellers.’ The scarity of sellers is the key to firm behavior in oligopoly.</p>
<p>A license fee on the monopolist will be viewed as a fixed cost and will increase average cost but not marginal cost. In this way, the monopoly profit can be taxed away with no effect on output.</p>
<p>Social Darwinism applied Charles Darwin’s theory of the evolution of the species, often summed up (and simplified) as a belief in the survival of the fittest, to business enterprise. Under that view stronger firms were justified in getting bigger by ‘gobbling up’ the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Regulation of monopoly leads to cost-plus pricing, which destroys cost minimizing incentives. Taxation of monopoly does not destroy these incentives, but it does not change the monopoly price and output.</p>
<p>In bilateral monopoly, a monopolistic seller, the union, sells labor to a monopsony firm. The wage rate will be logically indeterminate, depending on the relative bargaining strengths of the two participants.</p>
<p>The Coase theorem show how externalities are internalized by the assignment of property rights.</p>
