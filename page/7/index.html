        <p>Lesson 1 On the Cost of Holding Money<br>Thinking in the vein, one can look at a number of financial assets, ranging from Treasury bills to long-term bonds. If each of these has a nominal yield of rj, and if the inflation rate is π, then the real yield of the asset is rj-π.<br>On currency, which to my knowledge never bears a nominal yield, the real yield is always -π (the negative of the rate of inflation). This is, everywhere and always, the actual real yield of holding cash balances in the form of currency.<br>Simply changing signs, we can speak of the cost of holding currency as π, that of holding demand deposits as (π-rj). From here one can see a change in the rate of inflation generates an own-price effect on all components of money, while rises in different interest rates generally give rise to cross-price effect.</p>
<p>Lesson 2 For any component of Money Pays Interest, a Rise in its Interest Rate Increases the Demand for Real Balances of that Component<br>When I first started observing the Latin American scene in the mid-1950s, the main inflationary countries were in the Southern Cone of South America. The inflationary disease at that time took a particular and characteristic form. The countries had not yet come to accept inflation as their fate, nor had they learned to cut if off at its root (fiscal deficits financed by rapid monetary expansion). But they were always trying to bring inflation under control. Hence they held on to a number of policies that were at best weak reeds, and at worst downright counterproductive for their economies. Among these policies were:<br>(a) exchange rates that were held fixed, long beyond the point when economic evidence would have dictated a change;<br>(b) prohibit of interest payments on demand deposits;<br>(c) limitation of the interest rates on time and savings deposits (sometimes via regulations, sometimes via usury laws) to maximum levels that ended up being well below the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>When the inflationary fires began to burn, in such a setting, the cost of holding all types of money rose – currency, demand deposits, time and savings deposits were all rendered less attractive to hold, and, indeed, holdings of all of them declined in real terms, or at least as a fraction of GDP. But the notable fact was that time and savings deposits tended to decline much more than currency and demand deposits. U.S. dollars proved a far better store of value than did savings deposits during the inflationary episodes of the 1950s and 1960s, and so, too, of course, did virtually any durable physical asset. These types of assets proved to be much more ready substitutes for time and savings deposits than for currency and demand deposits. Hence the ratio of time and savings deposits to M2 fell sharply as a consequence of inflation.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to some of the same countries in the period starting with the mid-1970s. By this time financial markets had been very substantially freed. Interest rates on demand deposits tended to be limited, but those on time deposits were substantially freed. The result was that time deposits remained attractive assets to hold, and in certain cases became almost the single most attractive asset to hold. In Chile, for example, during the period 1976, the real rate of interest received by depositors on renewable 30-day time deposits averaged over 2-percent per month.</p>
<p>During this more recend period, the reaction of time and savings deposits to the phenomenon of inflation was quite the reverse of what it was in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead of the ratio of these to M2 going way down as a consequence of inflation, it went sharply up, or at worst held its own.</p>
<p>Lesson 3 On Moentary Expansions Driven by the Demand for Credit<br>In the old days, when both rates of interest, rd and rs were held significantly below the rate of inflation, (M1/Y) was low because of the mere fact of inflation, and (M2-M1)/Y was lower still, compared to what it would be in a normal, stable, non-inflationary equilibrium for the reasons set out in Lesson 2 above. The consequent low level of (M2-M1/Y) set a limit on the amount of real credit that the banking system could offer – the system’s total assets being pretty much dictated by the size of its total monetary liabilities. In short, as the public ran away from holding real monetary balances because of inflation (or inflation expextations), the supply of real credit was squeezed.</p>
<p>In the more recent situations, with modernized and competitive banking system, (M1/Y) was squeezed in much the same way as before, but (M2-M1)/Y could be substantially the same as in a non-inflationary equilibrium, or even higher, as holders of time and savings deposits were rewarded with real yields that were almost always positive and much of the time far above the real yields that people were accustomed to, even in non-inflationary environments.</p>
<p>Needless to say, when the markets for bank credit were modernized, the situation changed dramatically. Interest rates paid by borrowers came to be closely linked to those received by depositors (at least for time deposits). Credit rationing of the old type simply disappeared. As a result, the allocation of investible funds through the banking system came to be much more efficient. The interest rate came once again to play its natural role as a signal for the allocation of credit in the first instance, and beyond that, of investible resources.</p>
<p>The simplest way to describe the events leading up to the widespread failures of banks is that competition among banks got underway, but with a vengeance. The natural incentives and instincts of bankers led to a fierce competition for deposits, in which the deposits went mostly to those paying the highest interest rates. But those who paid the highest interest rates could do so only by receiving very high rates on their loans, which in turn only happened with the riskiest categories of loans. We now believe that with a greatly improved system of bank regulation, including much better articulated rules for government bailouts of failing banks, the great banking collapses of the 1980s might have been avoided.</p>
<p>Lesson 4 On Stocks and Flows: The Loanable Funds and the Liquidity Preference Approaches<br>(M/P) = L(Y, r)<br>S(Y, r) = I(r)<br>To try to put it in a different perspective, think of equation (1) not as a demand function for real cash balances but as a sort of semi-reduced-form equation describing the operation of the financial system. Looked at in this way it reads as follows:<br>If, for a given level of real income, there are large real cash balances, then the banking system will likely be willing to supply a large amount of loans, which in turn will conduce toward low interest rates. Conversely, low real money balances lead to small amounts of bank loans, hence to high interest rates. Here we have what is the quintessential liquidity preference function affecting the interest rate, but only via the supply of loanable funds from the financial system.</p>
<p>My own preference is to think of the long-term interest rate being determined in the market for long-term bonds and the short-term interest rate being determined in the market for the short-term paper. In each of these markets one can look at either stocks or flows, or both. But in reality, I think the aspect of stocks is more central, more critical in the market for, say, 30-year bonds, while the aspect of flows is more important in the market for, say, 90-days paper.</p>
<p>In an economy in which most real magnitudes are growing at around 3 percent per year, the annual ‘flow supply’ of 30-year bonds will be only about 6 percent of last year’s stock, while the annual flow supply of 90-days notes will be over 400 percent of last year’s stock.</p>
<p>The biggest task of the interest rate on 30-year bonds is to convince people to keep on holding the 97 percent of last year’s stock which does not come due this year, once this task has been performed, relatively minor variations in the rate will likely take care of the new flow supply that is coming on the market this year. In contrast, the entire stock of credit turns over four times a year in the market for 90-day paper. So here, flow considerations have a much greater relative impartance.</p>
<p>Once one realizes that it is quite possible for real interest rates to be significantly above the world market rate, there arises the question of how to ‘model’ this phenomenon – how to make it fit into a simplified but self-contained picture of a country’s macroeconomy. After much thought on this subject, motivated not only by the present chain of reasoning but by others, arising from different starting points, I have come to the conclusion that the most sensible way to model this phenomenon is via a ‘supply curve of foreign funds’ facing the economy in question, which has a significant upward slope.</p>
<p>Lesson 5 On Capital-Flow Linkages to the Rest of the World<br>The Mexican and Chilean cases are only two out of many in which there is a substantial gap between local interest rates and those of the major world financial centers. It is fashionable today to say that any such difference among interest rates is to be attributed to an expectation of devaluation of the currency with the higher rate.</p>
<p>Thus, I see Luxembourg as facing a flat, infinitely elastic supply curve of funds (over the relevant range of variation). But this obviously was not true of Chile or Mexico in the instances cited, and is not true of a great many developing countries where we observe significant differentials between their interest rates and those of the world market. Here, I believe the simpliest approach is to postulate an upward-rising supply curve of funds, without attributing the rate differential exclusively to an expectation of devaluation.</p>
<p>Lesson 6 On ‘Expected’ Magnitudes: Interest Rates, Inflation Rates, Devaluation Rates, etc.<br>I believe that we have gotten enormous mileage out of the capital asset pricing model, and out of similar insights applied to other areas, including expected rates of inflation and expected rates of devaluation in some circumstances.<br>But there are important cases where the collaspsing of expectations into a single representative view can fall far wide of the mark. In these cases we must recognize that supply and demand are more fundamental economic concepts, in the sense that we can (and do) have many markets in which the concept of a representative agent makes no sense.</p>
<p>In any case like the above, of things used for multiple purpose to fulfill quite different desires, it is quite clear that the relevant curves are unlikely to be flat.</p>
<p>We can postulate a rising supply curve of funds without asking that its slope be only due to expectations of devaluation, and without imaging that ‘typical’ market participants all share the same view on such a matter. If we simply stick with the idea of a rising supply curve, we can build a view in which incremental demand for funds in a developing country raises interest rates there, widening the spread between its interest rates and those of the world market. Within this framework, the incremental demand will be met partly by displacing investments, partly by stimulating domestic saving, and partly by attracting incremental funds from abroad. This vision of the process fits the evidence we have from most developing countries much better than does the notion of infinitely elastic supply curves of funds.</p>
<p>Lesson 7 On Shifting Appraisals of Developing Country Capital Markets.<br>One thing we can be quite sure of is that any scheme that tries to rationalize actual events in developing country capital markets must recognize that world market perceptions change through time – sometimes very dramatically.</p>
<p>That is why cross-sectional analysis using observations from different countries has been so difficult.</p>
<p>Taking the supply curves of funds to be upward sloping, as I have argued they are, we can somewhat enrich the simple picture of ‘shifting curves.’ For not only do these curves shift with changing circumstances, but there are systematic changes in their elasticities. If Luxembourg faces a curve of virtually infinite elasticity and no premium, and perhaps Angola or Burma a curve very low elasticity and a high premium, then the situations of other countries can take virtually any position in the spectrum thus defined. </p>
<p>Lesson 8 The Position and Elasticity of the Supply Curves of Funds Facing a Country are Critical for Understanding and Diagnosing its Economy<br>The first pillar of Buchi’s strategy was a dollar that was expensive in real terms. This would give a strong incentive to develop export activities and also would foster a healthy type of import substition. But while it is quite feasible (if not always easy) for a country to fix its nominal exchange rate with the dollar or some other foreign currency, the same cannot be side for the real exchange rate. Adjustments in real exchange rates may take place under a flexible system via movements of the nominal exchange rate. Under a fixed rate system, the same adjustments occur through internal inflation and deflation. A fixed nominal price of the dollar, initially set high, does not guarantee a high real rate for any significant length of time. This high dollar price would soon generate trade surpluses; these would be cashed at the Central Bank, causing monetary expansion. This would go on, in principle until the trade surplus was eliminated, which would happen when the real exchange rate was again in equilibrium. But this real exchange rate would entail a real price of the dollar quite a bit lower than the starting point, in which the price of the dollar was raised from an initial equilibrium level, with a view to stimulating exports. </p>
<p>What the Buchi team did, taking advantage of the foreign exchange control system that had been in existence all along, was to auction off to the private speculators the right to engage in this sort of debt repatriation. Since the demand of the speculators to do this was quite large, the government in effect extended the length of time over which the process was distributed. But that was not the purpose. The purpose was that of producing equilibrium in the market for foreign exchange at the real exchange rate that the government was targeting.</p>
<p>The force driving this major change in capital market equilibrium was Chile’s ever-closer linkage to the world capital market, with the quantities of foreign capital in Chile becoming ever bigger, and the premium over world interest rates becoming ever smaller. This brought with it the danger that as the government sucked funds out of the domestic market (in order to buy foreign exchange to keep the real exchange rate on target), foreign funds would quickly flow in to replace what the government got. In a perfectly linked capital market, this would lead to a situation where:<br>(a) interest rates do not change, and<br>(b) neither does the real exchange rate move from outside to within the target zone.<br>In effect, the government would be rendered virtually impotent, using the actions previously described, to influence either the interest rate or the real exchange rate. </p>
<p>Lesson 9 On the determination of the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate<br>Movements in the real exchange rate (RER) typically entail changing relative prices as between tradable and nontradable goods.</p>
<p>If the country has a fixed exchange rate system, the equilibrating mechanism is like that under a gold standard. A surplus in the balance of trade leads to an expansion in the money supply and a consequent rise of the prices of nontradables relative to tradables; a deficit works the other way. Thus, the equilibrating process under fixed exchange rates works through the country’s general price level rather than through its nominal exchange rate. But, either way, the real exchange rate, as defined above, can seek and reach its equilibrium level.</p>
<p>Mexicans may have billions of dollars of assets in the U.S.; that fact by itself has no impact on Mexicans’ real exchange rate, but if they are in the process of building up those assets, that fact operates to raise the real price of the dollar above what it would otherwise be, and if they are in the process of reducing their asset position abroad and repatriating their capital, that fact operates to lower the RER.</p>
<p>Lesson 10 On the Relationship between Real-Exchange-Rate Analysis and the Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments<br>For myself, I have never been uncomfortable with the terms like (Ms-Md), having learned from the most brilliant of Alfred Marshall’s insights that an observed point can simultaneously be one of equilibrium (in a short-term sense) and of disequilibrium (in a longer-term sense). To me, the existense of excess cash balances does not mean that it then becomes a puzzle why people are holding them. It means instead that so long as the other relevant determining variables remain the same; people will choose to engage in an adjustment process by which they bring these balances down to the longer-run demand level Md.</p>
<p>Lesson 11 On the Tantalizing Analogy between International Capital Flow and the Expansion of Domestic Bank Credit<br>(a) a capital flow from abroad spent fully on tradables, and<br>(b) a credit expansion at home to the same borrowers, also spent fully on tradables<br>Once again we have a corresponding loss of reserves, and when all the accounts are in, we have an increase in foreign liabilities in case (a), and a loss of foreign assets in case (b).</p>
<p>I do not claim here to have solved the puzzle of how far to extend the analogy between foreign borrowing on the one hand and domestic credit expansion on the other. I do hope, however, to have stimulated readers to puzzle and speculate further on this fascinating set of issues.</p>

        <p>Democracy is the sort of force that has been constantly expanded by the development of history; it is something that in itself requires creativity, renewal, and advancement in broader contexts and in more concrete ways. Because of this, when I say we need a democratic practice to cope with the problems that now face us, the democracy I am referring to – even though it includes the sum, the reflection on, and the development of all historical instances of democracy – by no means refers to a ready made pattern that can be readily copied. Rather, it should be a creative process, a broad social reality that takes into account specific political, economic, and cultural practices. It is precisely for this reason that I have attempted to see the predicament facing China and the crises afflicting the rest of the contemporary world – including the so called democratic Western world – as different facets of an interrelated historical process.</p>
<p>Like much contemporary Western analysis of this transformation, Wang’s account focuses on what are most often taken in the West as the contradictions of the process, notably rapid economic deregulation conjoined with a still highly intrusive state.</p>
<p>(Theodore Huters)<br>The creation of today’s market society was not the result of a sequence of spontaneous events, but rather of state interference and violence. In other words, were there no governments to set the terms and guarantee the structure of the markets that the advocates of this system – the neoliberals – claim to be regulated only by a Smithian invisible hand, these institutions would not have come into existence in the first place, could neither sustain themselves nor function as they do. This has marked a fundamental change in the world: ‘the core of the neoliral conception of globalization…no longer recognizes the division between politics and economic characteristic of the nineteenth century, but rather envisions the workings of the economy, markets, and capital as replacing the political and social spheres.’</p>
<p>Those in charge of implementing the last will and testament of the revolution [that is, the Party leadership] carry out their dual responsibilities in an absurd fashion: on the one hand they clownishly bury all of the reasonable aspects of the revolution and of socialism, while on the other they employ state violence and monopolization to guarantee the smooth transition of a Chinese economy in crisis to one based on market mechanisms, in the process wrecking all of the equitable features of the social guarantees contained within the old system.</p>
<p>The most one can say about the conflict between the Chinese version of neoliberalism and the ultraconservative state ideological apparatus is that it reflects an internal contradiction in the functioning of the state. While neoliberalism takes every opportunity to cast itself in the image of ‘resister’, this does not prove that this ideology of the market is in actual opposition to the practical operations of the state: on the contrary, the state and neoliberalism exist in a complex relationship of codependence.</p>
<p>There are many profound cautionary tales to be learned from Chinese socialism, but these lessons have nothing to do with the realization of egalitarianism. Quite on the contrary, they stemmed from the failure of its egalitarian objectives ever to be really implemented. In other words, what deserves criticism is not the victories won by the socialist movement in the realm of equality, but the new hierarchy and notions of social status that were created in the process.</p>
<p>It is clear that in different parts of the contemporary world, such as North America, Western Europe, Russia, and China, neoliberalism has its own historical roots and social patterns. These differences in historical circumstance have determined that there is no way to adduce convincing conclusions by merely summing up the character of neoliberalism at an abstract level.</p>
<p>The simultaneous existence of planned pricing and market pricing provided perfect conditions for corruption and official peculation.</p>
<p>The social contradiations of 1989 should not be understood as the state promoting reform and various elements of society opposing it, but rather as people demanding even greater reform, given the decline of the old system. The crux of the problem lay in specifying the shape that reform would take. Regardless of whether we are talking about students, intellectuals, or any others who participated in the movement in support of reform (political or economic) and demands for democracy, their hopes for and understanding of reform were extraordinarily diverse. When looked at from a broader or synthetic perspective, however, the reforms the greater part of the populace hoped for and their ideals of democracy and rule by law were for the purpose of guaranteeing social justice and the democratization of economic life through the restructuring of politics and the legal system. They did not wish for a set of political procdures and legal stipulations that were intended merely to demonstrate the legitimacy of carving up social assets as they existed at the time.</p>
<p>Any critical perspective on the problems of contemporary China should not cover up the amazing achievements brought about through this process of reform. In undertaking a historical analysis, however, we cannot ignore the profound and complicated consequences and historical imprints left by the state ideology.</p>
<p>Local and Beijing based interest groups welcomed the new initiative because new reforms signaled further devolution, which meant resolution of the contradictions that had arisen in the period of adjustment between central control and local interests.<br>The intellectuals welcomed the new initiative because they believed that as long as reforms were implemented and a market economy was created, then progress toward democracy in China would eventually take place.<br>Foreign public opinion welcomed this initiative because it meant that China was once again moving toward the fixed objective of ‘the end of history’.</p>
<p>The discourse of ‘the end of history’ that followed upon 1989, however, provided a clear-cut explanation of the events of that year: namely, that it represented the final victory of the Western social system, with China as werely an isolated and incomplete historical instance.</p>
<p>Should neoliberalism’s market program suddenly result in an economic crisis, it could lead to calls for protectionism and isolationism. The historical experiences of Asia and Europe all show that the strengthening of economic relations does not necessarily lead to peace, unity, and integration, and the crises created by market ideology can frequently lead to conflict and isolation; all sorts of ‘scared alliances’ have been formed with resistance, throttling of competition, protectionism, and war as their motives. Thus, critism of neoliberalism is not a rejection of free exchange and free trade, but rather rejection of the closures, protectionism, isolation, and tendencies toward conflict concealed in its developmental logic.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the discussion of practical matters cannot avoid returning to more theoretical and comprehensive reflections, since the crux of today’s problems cannot be seperated into isolated components. The discussion must root itself deeply in the internal logic of modern society, because if it fails to think things through at this level, a social movement of resistance and the critical thinking that goes along with it run the risk of slipping into the logic of that which they are resisting in the first place.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Chinese government’s persevering support for socilism does not pose an obstacle to the following conclusion: in all of its behaviors, including economic, politicl, and cultural – even in governmental behavior – China has completely conformed to the dictates of capital and the activities of the market. If we aspire to understand Chinese intelletual and cultural life in the last decade of the twentieth century, we must understand the above transformations and their corresponding social manifestations.</p>
<p>The end of the Cultural Revolution marked the end of a socialism characterized by perpetual revolution and the critique of capitalism. In 1978, the socialist reform movement that has lasted to this day began. On the level of ideology, the criticism of prior socialism forcused first on its idealistic system of public ownership and egalitarianism, both of which led to a decrease in efficiency, and second on the dictatorial methods that caused political damage to the whole country. At the same time as the evaluation and the historical summing-up were proceeding, China’s socialist reforms, with improved efficiency as their focus, were launched.</p>
<p>In addition, in the course of reform and opening up, China was gradually absorbed into the global capitalist  market. </p>
<p>These reforms have plainly advanced economic development and reshaped the preexisting social structure, but what they have abandoned is Mao’s idealistic modernization methods while continuing the goal of modernization. Different from prereform modernization, the most important chracteristics of the socialist reforms that China is now implementing are marketization in the economic arena and the convergence of the Chinese economy, society, and the culture with the contemporary capitalist system.</p>
<p>The astonishing achievements brought about in China by the contemporary socialist reforms are not limited to the economic arena, but also entail profound political implications.</p>
<p>The reconsideration of China’s problems by placing them in the context of globalization is an urgent theoretical problem. </p>
<p>The modern era, as a historical phase, continues. This provides the impetus for the continued existence and development of critical thought; it may prove for Chinese intellectuals to be a historic opportunity for theoretical and institutional innovation.</p>
