        <p>History, Politics, sociology, psychology and anthropology are suggestive, not conclusive, disciplines: they cannot prove (or more importantly disprove) any hypothesis. They should perhaps be more like economics, and economics should be more like them.</p>
<p>Mainstream economics has taught that markets ‘clear’ continuously. The big idea was that if wages and prices are completely flexible, resources will be fully employed. Any shock to the system will result in instantaneous adjustment of wages and prices to the new situation.</p>
<p>For thirty years or so after the Second World War, Keynesian economics ruled the roost, at least in the sense that Keynesian policy – trying to keep economies fully employed and growing on an even keel – was part of the normal toolkit of governments. Then it was thrown out, as economics reverted to its older doctrine that market economies were internally self-correcting and that it was government intervention which make them behave badly. The free-market era of Reagan and Thatcher dawned.</p>
<p>Taking uncertainty seriously – which few economists today do – has profound implications not just for how one does economics and how one applies it, but for one’s understanding of practically all aspects of human activity. It helps explain the rules and conventions by which people live.</p>
<p>The economists’ definition of rational behaviour as behaviour consistent with their own models, with all other behaviour dubbed irrational, amounts to a huge project to reshape humanity into people who believe the things economists believe about them.</p>
<p>Keynes wat not a nationalizer, nor even much of a regulator. He came not exactly to praise capitalism, but certainly not to bury it. He thought that, for all its defects, it was the best economic system on offer, a necessary stage in the passage from scarcity to abundance, from toil to the good life.</p>
<p>The shift in focus from the Keynes of ‘underemployment equilibrium’ to the Keynes of ‘uncertain expectations’ allows for a direct confrontation between contemporary theories of risk and risk management and Keynes’s theory of uncertainty and uncertainty reduction.</p>
<p>As Keynes famously remarked, ‘The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly supposed. Indeed the world is ruled by little else.’</p>
<p>Macroecoomics is divided into two major schools: New Classicals and New Keynesians. The New Keynesians accuse the New Classicals of living in the Dark Ages. The New Classicals accuse the New Keynesians of being pre-Copernican. The two schools are sharply divided over the merits of the ‘stimulus’.</p>
<p>Rational expectations hypothesis (REH) was not intended by its adherents to be a literal description of how people actually behave. One of its leaders, Robert Lucas, had always emphasized the fictional character of his models. The predictive performance of REH models is notoriously had. REH was advanced as a solution to an abstract problem: What conditions of knowledge would be required for markets to be perfectly efficient? Efficiency has always been the normative goal of economics. If the conditions required for market efficiency could be specified, and, over time, realized, then poverty would be eradicated, and the role of government in the economy suitably diminised. Economists therefore set out to build a Platonic world of perfect efficiency, which was nevertheless supposed to have sufficient warrant in terms of human computing abilities and the nature of the universe to make it an acceptable basis for economics theorizing. Unfortunately most policy makers – and even economists – failed to distinguish statements of logical possibility from descriptions of the real world, an ambiguity which REH is happy to accommodate.</p>
<p>The crucial assumption of REH is not perfect competition, but perfect information.</p>
<p>In Alan Greenspan’s words, ‘Probability distributions estimated largely, or exclusively over cycles that do not include periods of panic will underestimate the likelihood of extreme price movements… Furthermore, joint distributions estimated over periods that do not include panics will underestimate correlations between asset returns during panics.’</p>
<p>But Greenspan’s explanation for failure of the models does not go far enough. The failure is not only a matter of limited data: ultimately, it is a matter of limited applicability. One cannot apply insurance models to non-insurable products. </p>
<p>Here is the New Keynesian Joe Stiglitz: ‘Failure in financial markets… have highlighted the importance of informationn imperfection… The results were clear: the financial system failed to perform the functions which it is supposed to perform, allocating capital efficiently and managing risk.’</p>
<p>The dominant economics of the last thirty years encouraged and promoted a system in which financial blizzards like this could occur, and more often than once in a hundred years. It did so from a mistaken belief that all risk can be correctly priced and that therefore financial markets are optimally self-regulating.</p>
<p>Keynes’s particular criticism of the classical school was that it used models which assumed certain things which did not occur in the real world: perfect flexibility of wages and prices, perfect competition, perfect information, and absence of contractual debt – equivalent to absence of money. He rejected the type of reasoning which started with the absence of money (the real-exchange economy) and then ‘added on’ money as a disturbing or complicating factor. Keynes was the first major economist to make money an integral part of economic analysis. It was the primary hedge against uncertainty. His own General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money offered the world a ‘monetary theory of production’. ‘A monetary economy’, he wrote in his preface to that book, ‘is one in which changing views about the future are capable of influencing the quantity of employment and not merely its direction.’ In that pregnant sentence is the core of the Keynesian revolution. </p>
<p>Under capitalism, uncertainty is generated by the system itself, because it is an engine for accumulating capital goods whose rewards come not now but later. The engine of wealth creation is at the same time the source of economic and social instability.</p>
<p>In a stream of letters and articles criticizing the use of econometrics, dating from the late 1930s, Keynes seemed to veer away from the view that there is a map of the future which we can’t yet read to the view that human beings make their own map. He makes for main points:</p>
<p>First, he argues that employing regression analysis to get parameters and then treat them as if they were constant is fundamentally flawed. ‘There is no reason at all why they should not be different every year,’ since we know that many economic relations are ‘nonhomogeneous through time’.</p>
<p>Second, Keynes criticises the ad hoc character of much quantitative modeling. ‘With a free hand to choose coefficients and time lags, one can, with enough industry, always cook a formula to fit moderately well a limited range of past facts. But what does this prove?’ Too much is expected of the data, he continued. It often is not detailed enough to even ‘support one-tenth of the burden which is placed on’.</p>
<p>Third, in sharp contrast to modern economics, Keynes argued that, rather than assuming that quantitative analysis is appropriate when investigating a problem, the default assumption should be the opposite: assume that you cannot use it, and justify the instances when you do. There are simply ‘such important iinfluences which cannot be reduced to statistical form’.</p>
<p>This view underlies his fourth point: there are areas in which statistical analysis can be very useful, but they are limited to simpler, less abstract, relations. ‘The notion of testing the quantitative influence of factors suggested by a theory as being important is very useful and to the point. The question to be answered, however, is whether the complicated method… does not result in a false precision beyond what the method… can support.’ Thus, although credit cycles might be too complex to analyse statistically, Keynes gives the example of the relation between the volume of traffic and the operating costs of a railway system as a case where econometric analysis might warrant some valid conclusions.</p>
<p>The main conclusion to deduce from these points is that Keynes viewed economics as a ‘moral’ science, not a natural science. Although some aspects could be reduced to numbers, much could not. In particular, innovation, a human achievement, destroys regularities. Keynes would have said that it is absurd to rely on risk models based on past data at the moment bankers were creating complex new products every week.</p>
<p>People’s freedom in a monetary economy not to spend money is the crux of his denial of Say’s Law, that production creats its own demand.</p>
<p>He broke up the ‘aggregate demand function’ into two components: consumption demand and investment demand. These these determine the volume of output and employment. Consumption was the stable element in demand, investment the unstable element.</p>
<p>According to Keynes’s ‘psychological law’, when income increases, consumption rises by less than income, and when income decreases consumption falls by less.</p>
<p>Keynes insisted that a decision to save is not equivalent to placing an order for future consumption. His ‘liquidity-preference’ theory of saving is set out in his ‘paradox of thrift’. If everyone wants to save more, firms will sell less and therefore output will fall, unless the inducement to invest is increasing at the same time. So the more ‘thrifty’ a society is, the more difficulty it will have in maintiaing full employment. </p>
<p>Moreover, since recoveries increase the amount saved, simply as a consequence of incomes rising, saving the investment may well be equalized before full employment is regained. This was the basis of Keynes’s view that, under laissez-faire, recoveries are liable to peter out. It is spending, not saving, which creats output and employment; and when spending falls short of earnings, unemployment results.</p>
<p>We assume that the present is a much more serviceable guide to the future than a candid examination of the past experience would show it to have been hitherto. In other words, we largely ignore the prospect of future changes about the actual character of which we know nothing.</p>
<p>We assume that the existing state of opinion, as expressed in prices… is based on a correct summing up of future prospects.</p>
<p>Knowing that our own individual judgement is worthless, we endeavour to fall back on the judgement of the rest of the world, which is perhaps better informed. That is, we endeavour to conform with the behaviour of the majority or the average. The psychology of a society of individuals each of whom is endeavouring to copy the other leads to what we may strictly term a conventional judgement.</p>
<p>The market will be subject to waves of optimistic and pessimistic sentiment, which are unreasoning, yet in a sense legitimate, where no solid basis exists for a reasonable calculation.</p>
<p>The uncertainty attaching to the future yield of investment has given rise to a peculiar institution through which most investment is channelled in a capitalist society: the stock market.</p>
<p>Keynes was here anticipating something which has been subsequently developed by behavioural psychologists: that our tendency to follow the crowd may be ‘hard-wired’. The demand for ‘social proof’ – if people behave in a certain way they must have a reason for doing so – may be a survival instinct.</p>
<p>Trust would not be necessary if all agents had statistically based expectations of other’s behaviour. He placed so much stress on this point precisely because economists ignored the influece of uncertainty in shaping human behaviour and social institutions.</p>
<p>The rate of interest, Keynes writes, is the price which equilibrates the desire to hold wealth in the form of cash with the available quantity of cash.</p>
<p>The economy is not a see-saw, but a leaky balloon.</p>
<p>Keynes conceded that relative price adjustments might come into play in the ‘long period’, but only as a result of the decline in output, not as an alternative to it.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘underemployment equilibrium’ should not be taken too literally. It encapsulates the idea of the lack of an efficacious mechanism for righting economies after a major capsize. It also expresses Keynes’s belief that suboptimal performance is normal, because the growth of economies takes place in the twilight world of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Keynes’s chief domestic prophylactic against uncertainty was what he called ‘cheap money, wise spending’. To offset fluctuations in private investment demand, money should be kept permanently cheap, and the state’s capital budget, which consists of all public, or publicly influenced, investment programmes, should be used to keep total spending at a high level. By contrast, the government’s ‘ordinary’ budget for current spending should normally be in surplus… If this is successful it should not be too difficult to offset small fluctuations by expeditiing or retarding some items in this longer-term programme.’</p>
