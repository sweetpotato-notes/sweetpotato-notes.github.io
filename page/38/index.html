        <p>The economists, misled by the logical priority of perfect competition in their scheme, were somehow trapped into thinking that it must be of equal importance in the real world.</p>
<p>Perfect competition prevails when the demand for the output of each producer is perfectly elastic. This entails, first, that the number of sellers is large, so that the output of any one seller is a negligibly small proportion of the total output of the commodity, and second, that buyers are all alike in respect of their choice between rival sellers, so that the market is perfect.</p>
<p>Demand curves – The demand curve for a particular commodity in a given market represents a list of the amounts of that commodity which would be bought at various prices, all other conditions remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>Supply curves – The supply curve of a commodity shows, for each amount of the commodity, the price per unit which it is necessary to pay in order that that amount of it shall be produced.</p>
<p>The demand curve for the output of the individual firm will normally be falling. Its elasticity will depend upon many factors, of which the chief are the number of other firms selling the same commodity and the degree to which substitution is possible, from the point of view of buyers, between the output of other firms and the output of the firm in question.</p>
<p>Perfect competition is never likely to prevail in the production of any actual commodity, but it provides a limiting case of imperfect competition which is of considerable service in analysis. Conditions approximating closely to perfect produce market, such as the corn exchange in a large market town.</p>
<p>A demand curve which continues to be inelastic, however high the price, is obviously an absurdity. There must be some point at which sales begin to fall off rapidly as price is raised, and if a monopolist finds himself faced with an inelastic stretch of the demand curve, he will raise price until the demand begins to become elastic.</p>
<p>If the demand curve is perfectly elastic marginal revenue and price are equal, and the output will be such that marginal cost is equal to price.</p>
<p>It may happen, however, that there are several points of equilibrium, and if he hits upon one of them there will be no tendency for him to move, even though a greater net revenue could be gained at some other point.</p>
<p>Cases of multiple equilibrium may arise when the demand curve changes its slope, being highly elastic for a stretch, then perhaps becoming relatively inelastic, then elastic again. This may happen, for instance, in a market composed of several groups of consumers each with a different level of incomes. There will be several critical points at which a decline in price suddenly brings the commodity within the reach of a whole fresh group of consumers so that the demand curve becomes rapidly more elastic. The marginal revenue curve corresponding to such a demand curve may fall and rise and fall again, and there will be several points of monopoly equilibrium.<br>Moreover, even if the marginal revenue curve falls consistently, the shape of the marginal cost curve may be such that there are several points of equilibrium.</p>
<p>The net monopoly revenue at each point would be different, but it is unlikely that any monopolist would have sufficient knowledge of the situation to enable him to choose the greatest one from among them. If the monopolist had reached one equilibrium point there would be no influence luring him towards another at which his gains might be greater.</p>
<p>If the demand curve is raised in such a way that the second demand curve is iso-elastic with the first, the price will be increased, reduced, or remain the same according as marginal costs are rising, falling, or constant.<br>If marginal costs are constant, and the new demand is less elastic than the old (at the old price), the price will rise; if it is more elastic, the price will fall.</p>
<p>Under increasing supply price, since each additional purchase which the monopsonist makes raises the price which he must pay, the marginal cost to him is greater than the supply price of the commodity. Supply price is average cost to the monopsonist, but he will regulate his purchases by reference to marginal cost.<br>If the industry is working under decreasing supply price, he will find that every increase in his purchases lowers the supply price, and marginal cost to him, which is the same thing as marginal cost to the industry, will be less than the supply price. He will therefore buy more than the competitive amount.</p>
