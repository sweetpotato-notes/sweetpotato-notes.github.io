        <p>Schumpeter first used the phrase creative destruction in 1942, to describe how innovative capitalist products and methods continually displace old ones. He gave abundant examples. The factory wiped out the blacksmith shop, the car superseded the horse and buggy, and the corporation overthrew the proprietorship. ‘Creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism,’ he wrote. ‘Stabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms.’</p>
<p>Questions about capitalism – what it is, how and why it has worked well in some place and not others – are among the most important that people and governments have faced. This has been true for about three hundred years, and seldom more so than in the present and the recent past. Recall the turbulent transition from the last decade of the twentieth century to the initial one of the twenty-first: the sudden collape of communism, for seventy years a serious challenger to capitalism; the riotous prosperity of the 1990s, when entrepreneurs became folk heroes; the ensuing epidemic of corporate scandals, which bankrupted shareholders and employees and disgraced capitalism itself; then the scourge of international terrorism, portending warfare without end; and finally the spectacular economic gains in many parts of the world – most notably China, which combined a new capitalist economic system with an old communist political regime.</p>
<p>Some of the clearest guides to these kinds of questions come from Schumpeter, who assessed capitalism as an expression of innovation, human drama, and sheer havoc – all going on at once. He told of capitalism in the way most people experience it: as consumer desires aroused by endless advertising; as forcible jolts up and down the social pecking order; as goals reached, shattered, altered, then reached once more as people try, try again. For capitalism, and for Schumpeter personally, nothing was ever stable. Uproar was their only music.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur, Schumpeter once wrote, is ‘the pivot on which everything turns.’ Entrepreneurs – whether they operate in big firms or small ones, old companies or startups – are the agents of innovation and creative destruction. Their projects are the wellsprings of new jobs, higher incomes, and general economic progress. But in releasing their creative energies, rising entrepreneurs shove older ones aside, destroying their dreams and often their fortunes. The majority of people, even in rich countries, will never become entrepreneurs. Some will not even find employment in successful enterprises. And sooner or later, most business will fail, sometimes damaging whole communities as well as individuals.</p>
<p>Hundreds of first-rate thinkers have grapped with these issues. Two of the very greatest, Adam Smith and Karl Marx, came to opposite conclusions. Smith (1723-1790) saw the market economy as a nearly ideal system, whereas Marx (1818-1883) denounced it as an unpleasant interval on the inevitable path to socialism. Schumpeter, born late enough to study capitalism in its twentieth-century maturity, surpassed both of his more famous predecessors in analytical sophistication.</p>
<p>But capitalism is not the natural state of human existence. If it were, it would have emerged much earlier in history and would now prevail almost everywhere. Instead, it is an uncommonly difficult system to construct and sustain. Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’ is still essential, but it is no longer sufficient, any more than are the eighteenth-century waterwheels Smith so admired. Modern capitalism must be actively nurtured and controlled, with sophistication and resolve. Without constant promotion by entrepreneurs and careful monitoring by regulators (a necessity much underestimated by many advocates of the free market, including Schumpeter himself), it cannot achieve or maintain its full potential. Like the actual engines that loom so large in creative destruction – steam, electric, diesel, gasoline, jet – the capitalist engine can slow down, sputter, overheat, explode, or die.</p>
<p>Here, Schumpeter seems to be clarifying the role of capital in capitalism. The Oxford English dictionary defines capital as ‘accumulated wealth reproductively employed.’ That is a wonderful definition. But capitalism is something else again, because it relies so heavily on credit – wealth that has not yet been accumulated. Credit must be created out of nothing but future expectations, which is a basic reason why capitalism, of all economic systems, is so distinctly oriented toward the future.</p>
<p>The way to understand general economic expansions, Schumpeter goes on to say, is to break them down by looking closely at particular industries. The origins of broad expansions always come from innovations in specific industries, which then ramify into other parts of the economy – the suppliers of these industries, the distributor, and ultimately the customers. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, economic growth came in clear sequences of leading-sector breakthroughs: first in textile, then in steam engines and iron, then in electricity and chemicals. Overall, industry-specific innovation ‘does not follow, but creates expansion.’</p>
<p>Schumpeter’s key point here is one he hammered home many times: it is the insatiable pursuit of success, and of the towering premium it pays, that drives entrepreneurs and their investors to put so much of their time, effort, and money into some new project whose future is completely uncertain. High entrepreneurial returns are essential to generate gains not only for individuals but also for society, through the creation of new jobs. Financial ‘speculation,’ though it gets a very bad press, is an important part of this process. Speculators often turn out to be investment bankers funding the entrepreneurs who in turn push innovations through the economy.</p>
<p>‘Capitalist evolution spells disturbance,’ Schumpeter emphasizes again ad again. ‘Capitalism is essentially a process of (endogenous) economic change.’ In the absence of change, ‘capitalist society cannot exist.’ If the capitalist engine stalls, the economic system will disintegrate. And the key that starts the engine and keeps it running is innovation: ‘Without innovations, no entrepreneures; without entrepreneurial achievement, no capitalist returns and no capitalist propulsion. The atmosphere of industrial revolutions – of ‘progress’ – is the only one in which capitalism can survive.’ Hence there must be constant change, generated from within. ‘In this sense,’ Schumpeter concludes, ‘stabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms.’</p>
<p>Perfect competition lends itself very well to mathematical modeling, however, and that advantage has been almost irresistible to economists. But because it neglects the dynamics of creative destruction, Schumpeter finds perfect competition wholly unsuitable for understanding a modern capitalist economy. When, for example, a new product or process is introduced, all buyers and sellers cannot possibly have complete information about potential markets. ‘As a matter of fact,’ Schumpeter writes, ‘perfect competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever anything new is being introduced.’ And the continual emergence of new products and new ways of doing things is ‘the fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion.’</p>
<p>One result of the alterative approach Schumpeter proposes would be a sharper focus on product quality and marketing as elements of competition. This new perspective wourld reduce what had been an overwhelming emphasis on the analysis of price. ‘In capitalist reality as distinguished from its textbook picture, it is not [that kind of] competition which counts but the competition from the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of organization.’ This kind of competition ‘strikes not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives.’ It is effective even ‘when it is merely an ever-present threat. It disciplines before it attacks.’ A theoretical analysis that ‘neglects this essential element of the case neglects all that is most typically capitalist about it; even if in logic as well as in fact, it is like Hamlet without the Danish prince.’</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Schumpeter argues, socialism poses more problems for democracy than capitalism does. Capitalism has the advantage because bourgeois life restricts ‘the sphere of politics by limiting the sphere of public authority.’ Once the requisite legal framework is in place, capitalist business is largely self-regulating. It does not require constant political interference, because its laws adroitly guard individual freedom and autonomy. ‘Modern democracy rose along with cpitalism, and in causal connection with it.’</p>
