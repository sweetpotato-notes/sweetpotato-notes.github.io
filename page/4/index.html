        <p>I have for this purpose defined chronic inflation as a condition in which price increases of more than 20 percent per annum have been typical over an extended period.</p>
<p>Two key lessons flow from Table 1.<br>The first is that there is a close relationship between the rate of inflation and the rate of increase in the money supply.<br>The second is that the rate of monetary expansion tends, even in these chronic inflations, to be greater than the rate of increase of prices.</p>
<p>However, we know too, from common sense and from experience, that inflation operates as a tax on holdings of money. Thus it is also reasonable that the size of real cash balances should be less in an inflationary environment than it would be if there were little or no inflation. This tendency for inflation itself to lead people to economize on their holdings of cash does not show up in the data for chronic inflations. This can be explained in either of two ways.<br>First, people reduce their cash balances in the process of adapting to an inflationary situation. Once they have made their adaption – say by reducing their average bank balance from six weeks’ income to four weeks’ income, they will tend to stay at the new level unless the rate of inflation goes up. Therefore if we observe a country that has an inflation rate of 30 percent per year in the mid-1950s, and continues oscillating around that level into the mid 1960s, we should not expect people to be reducing their real cash holdings in the interim. The reduction would have occurred earlier – in the process of getting from zero or low rates of inflation up to 30 percent.<br>The second reason underlying the observation that the money supply has risen more rapidly than the price level during periods of chronic inflation is simply that the forces of population growth and rising real income levels continue to work even in an inflationary setting. Their effects cumulate through time, and when a long span of years is involved they can easily outweigh the tendency for an increased rate of inflation to cause people to reduce their cash holdings.</p>
<p>Thus we have (1) similarity of rates within each period among the industrial countries, (2) similarity of rates within each period between the selected LDC’s and the industrial countries, and (3) a significant change in the pace of inflation between periods. I believe that one must recognize from these figures the validity of the notion of a ‘world inflation.’ It is not by accident that so many countries have moved, almost in lock-step, through successive, closely similar inflationary experiences. Much more plausible is the idea that they were co-participants in a common process of world inflation.</p>
<p>This interpretation is further strengthened when it is realized that for most of the period under review the bulk of the world was on a system of fixed exchange rates. And just as the cause of inflation in Illinois cannot differ much from that of inflation in Ohio, so long as both states share a common currency and allow goods and services to move freely in and out, so too the cause of inflation in Costa Rica or Iran or the Philippines cannot be very different from that of the ‘world inflation’ so long as they maintain a fixed exchange rate with the major currencies, and so long as they do not introduce dramatic new interferences with the movement of goods and services.</p>
<p>Then in the period since 1973 the major currencies have all floated vis-avis one another, making the notion of a world money supply even more of an abstraction. Yet I still believe that the notion is a good one, generating insights that lead to more fruitful interpretations of reality than the alternative of assuming that each country’s monetary authorities behaved independently. Even though we have ahd nearly five years of floating rates, it is my impression that the monetary authorities of the major countries have behaved with far less independence than the theorists of floating rates are prone to assume. Consequently, in terms of the way the international monetary system has worked since 1973, I would characterize it as a hybrid, functioning if anything more like a fixed-exchange-rate system than like a textbook case of floating rates.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, then, a government intent on borrowing from the banking system at a rate more rapid than that compatible with stable prices, is going to have to expand the money supply at an inflationary pace. This has been the historic source of nearly all chronic and acute inflations.</p>
<p>The reasons why private-sector credit inflations get started (and keep going) are harder to understand than those relating to inflations caused principally by fiscal deficits. Usually there is some entity that has the power to expand credit without being subject to stern control by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The thought is that credit which is for productive purposes is not inflationary, a notion sometimes dubbed ‘the real bills doctrine.’ Plausible though it may appear at first glance, the proposition does not survive close examination. A country’s money supply will typically be equal to something between one and two months’ income. An effort to extend credit equal to even three or four months’ production would be frustrated by inflation, unless the credit came from outside the monetary system. This is so simply because people would not be willing to hold three or four months’ income in the form of money balances.</p>
<p>The rapid rise in international reserves, which started in 1969, stemmed from a variety of causes. The expansion of the supply of United States dollars (which have been for half a century the key currency in the international system) accelerated somewhat under the strains of the Vietnam War. Simutaneously, the world banking system created important new supplies of dollars (Eurodollars) and of some other currencies (German marks, Swiss francs) as it expanded its lending operations denominated in these moneys. Quite independently, but more or less at the same time, there was a significant growth of SDRs (Special Drawing Rights), the new ‘world money’ created within and by the International Monetary Fund to add to the supply of international reserves. Finally, in the mid-1970s there was an expansion of lending by the International Monetary Fund to the Central Banks of its member countries, most of it under the rubric of the IMF Oil Facility, a series of credits advanced to the countries that were hardest hit by the dramatic oil price rise of 1974.</p>
<p>Three effects now enter the picture, all produced by the disequilibrium situation just described:<br>a) People will attempt to reconstitute the shortfall in their real cash balances, simply by spending less than normal for a time. Part of this reduction in spending will fall on purely domestic goods, but part will fall on traded goods, thus inducing a tendency to surplus in the balance of payments and a consequent ‘importation of money.’<br>b) People will also attempt to reconstitute their shortfall of real cash by borrowing. This can be accomplished either through the domestic monetary authorities permitting the expnsion of credit (and money supply), or through borrowing from abroad. If the domestic expansion takes place rapidly enough, this can forestall all the other adjustment mechanisms by itself ‘financing’ a rise of domestic goods prices to match that of traded goods. But to the extent borrowing from abroad is also involved, this second avenue of adjustment also entails an ‘importation of money.’<br>c) Finally, to the extent that neither (a) nor (b) succeeds in rapidly bringing domestic prices into line with world prices, there will be a substitution effect at work, causing people to shift their expenditures away from internationally traded and toward purely domestic goods and services, once again producing an improvement in the balance of payments and an ‘importation of money.’</p>

        <p>The issue is that a rise in the price of any commodity can have two possible interpretations:<br>(a) it can signal a rising relative scarcity or desirability or real cost of that commodity, or<br>(b) it can simply indicate that the commodity in question is being affected by an ongoing process of inflation.<br>For an economy to operate efficiently, economic agents must respond to signals of type (a), producing more of the goods whose relative desirability has increased, using more of the inputs that have become relatively more abundant, and so on.<br>In a world in which the stability of the general level of prices is more or less ensured, economic agents can be sure that the price movements they perceive are essentially type (a) signals. They can therefore respond relatively quickly and recorder their input and output mix in an efficient way.<br>But in a situation of ongoing inflation, there can be considerable uncertainty as to whether any given price movement is of type (a) or type (b).</p>
<p>The consequences for growth are less obvious but probably more important. They stem from the fact that improvements in total factor productivity (TFP) have probably been the most important single source of economic growth, worldwide, at least since the industrial revolution.<br>TFP improvements can be viewed as increases in output per unit of ‘total inputs’ or, equivalently, as reductions in real cost of producing a unit of output. I believe that the latter vision brings greater insight into the growth process, for it leads one to sense how the growth process depends on the success of businessmen and managers in the perpetual search for ways of reducing real production costs (or of making at the same cost a product that has a higher value in the market).<br>In this search, relative prices play an absolutely critical role. If these prices are poorly or mistakenly perceived, fewer ways of reducing real costs will be discovered and implemented, and real economic growth will accordingly be slower.</p>
<p>But, in real-world inflations, individual price adjust at widely different rates – some rapidly, some slowly, some steadily, some in discrete jumps. Thus, even if there were no movements of type (a) at all, or if they were relatively minor, one would observe relative price changes owing to the different speeds and patterns of adjustment of individual prices to an ongoing inflationary process.<br>It is these relative price changes that are confused with those of type (a) and that thereby impede the efficient operation of the economy and slow down growth by slowing the advance of total factor productivity.</p>
<p>The easiest way to obtain a clear understanding of the phenomenon of inflation is by studying the link between money and inflation. People hold money for various purposes, but it is quite correct to say that, whatever the purpose, it is the real value of money that comes into play in serving that purpose.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand the examples presented so far is to assume that no interest is paid on money holdings and that borrowers from banks pay only a modest service charge, perhaps disguised as interest. Under these assumptions, the inflation tax is paid by the holders of M2, the government receives command over the resources released in the case of panel A, and the government and the productive sector share command over the resources released in the case of panel B.</p>
<p>I believe that the magnitude and extent of arbitrary redistribution connected with inflation constitute an additional important reason why governments should make every effort to keep inflation rates low. But I also believe that these redistributions are too complicated, too pervasive throughout the economy, to help us very much as we analyze the process of inflation itself. For that, I believe that the correct monetary magnitude to watch is M2, and that the analysis of changes in M2 should be matched to changes in its counterparts on the asset side of the balance sheet of the consolidated banking system – namely, net foreign assets, bank credit to the government, and bank credit to the productive sector.</p>
<p>At the begining of this paper, I spoke of how inflation impedes the efficient operation of the economy and interferes with economic growth. The causal connection emphasized was the way in which inflation blurs the price signals to which economic agents respond. This blurring of signals impedes the achievement of economic efficiency and hampers the search for innovations that produce economic growth through the reducion of real costs.</p>
<p>Here, I shall focus on a different causal connection, which runs as follows. The higher the rate of inflation, the lower the level of real money balances that people will want to hold. The lower the real money balances (the principal liabilities of the consolidated banking system), the lower the amount of domestic credit that the banking system can extend. Even with constant real credit to the government sector (say in relation to GDP), this will mean that, the higher the rate of inflation, the lower the amount of real credit to the productive sector (again, say, in relation to GDP). Lower credit to the productive sector is likely to affect economic growth directly by reducing that sector’s level of investment. It is also likely to have a negative impact on the efficiency with which the economy operates to the extent that credit, by ‘lubricating’ the economic machine, helps it operate more efficiently. </p>
<p>It can and sometimes does happen that other balance sheet items may be changing through time in such a way as to distort or offset the expected negative relationship between credit variables and the rate of inflation. Three important ways in which this relationship can be offset should be mentioned:<br>(1) net foreign assets may vary substantially (even becoming negative), thus permitting the credit variables to move in a different direction from the monetary variables,<br>(2) the government may turn from being a net recipient of credit from the banking system to being a net lender to it, and<br>(3) the banking system may expand its own capital, and/or may issue long-term bonds, providing it with the means to expand bank credit beyond what would be permitted by the prevailing levels of money and quasi money.<br>None of these variable really destroys the relationships being explored in this section, because changes in the rate of inflation do not by themselves have the effects described in (1)-(3) above. What can happen, however, is that one or another of these effects can occur side by side with an inflation process, thus obscuring empirical regularities of the types shown in the figures.</p>
<p>There is in the history of economic thought an important controversy concerning the relationship between bank credit and inflation. One side of this controversy asserts, with varying caveats and qualifications, that credit expansion is not inflationary as long as the credit is used to finance productive activities. This sums up what is known as the real bills doctrine. It has been shown, time and again, to be false.<br>As is the case with many technical concepts, this doctrine was far more noxious in the hands of politicians, bankers, and businessmen than in the hands of technical economists. The real bills doctrine was music to the ears of these three groups, for it gave a certain legitimacy to massive credit expansion. One simply did not have to worry about possible inflationary consequences, the doctrine said, as long as the credit went to finance productive activities.</p>
<p>Thus, making full allowances for the use of incremental credit to finance new investments, and making a generous allowance for the real productivity of such investments, one still finds that merely financing productive investments is no guarantee against inflation. The right way to think about inflation is in terms of the real cash balances that people are willing to hold. The real bills doctrine is of no use in this process. </p>
<p>Although the real bills doctrine has been the most powerful myth supporting the massive expansion of credit to the productive sector, it is impossible to confirm that the real-world cases of inflations that were principally fueled by credit expansions to the private sector were primarily motivated by this doctrine. However, it is possible to show that such inflations have in fact existed, even though most real-world inflations have stemmed from fiscal deficits.</p>
<p>These examples are anomalies in the history of inflations, but they call attention to the critical role of monetary expansion in creating inflation and to the virtual certainty that any major monetary expansion will have its counterpart somewhere on the asset side of the consolidated banking system’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>The point I would like to make here is that Central American fiscal deficits became significant quite some time before the actual crisis was felt. What happened was that different ways were found to ‘park’ (i.e., ‘place’ or ‘finance’) the deficit in a noninflationary way.<br>A government’s first priority ‘parking place’ for the deficit is probably abroad – by selling instruments of debt to foreigners.<br>Other ways of parking deficits include (1) selling bonds to the social security system; (2) raising the reserve requirements of banks, and permitting (or requiring) them to hold government bonds as part of these reserves; (3) reducing the support that the government gives to public sector enterprises, requiring them to eliminate their own deficits or else cover them through their own borrowing; and (4) passing certain functions (like price supports for agriculture) from the government to the central bank, thus eliminating them as components of the central government’s own deficit.<br>Some of these devices are more cosmetic than real; that is, they ‘hide’ the deficit rather than park it. Yet countries often engage in these activities, which can postpone the time when a given substantial ‘true’ fiscal deficit finally has its full impact on the money supply and hence on the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>I knew from both theory and observation that there was a close causal relation between price inflation on the one hand and monetary expansion on the other. But I also knew from experience that this connection was familiar to those who presided over and ran the central banks of the above countries during the listed episodes. The question then arose of why exaggreated rates of monetary expansion had occurred.<br>In an exercise I called ‘looking beyond the money supply,’ I defined three key variables:<br>β = net increase of banking system credit to the government (public sector) expressed as a fraction of GDP for the period;<br>γ = banking system credit to the public sector as a fraction of total bank credit; and<br>λ  = rate of increase of total (nominal) bank credit.<br>These variables proved to be very useful in discriminating between cases of chronic and acute inflation on the one hand and the cases of the ‘normal’ developing countries on the other, whose experience with price stability was similar to that of the industrial countries.</p>
<p>The following lessons can be drawn from these findings.<br>(1) The government’s borrowing new money from the banking system, if carried beyond a certain point, exposes the country to greater inflation risk, the greater the amount of the borrowing;<br>(2) having a high fraction of outstanding government debt in the total portfolio of the banking system itself exposes the nation to a higher risk of inflation; and<br>(3) increasing the rate of expansion of total bank credit adds to the risk of inflation.</p>
<p>Neither of the above arguments stands up under close examination. I have no quarrel with recognizing that H is, to a certain degree, a direct instrument of central bank policy control, but that does not mean that it should be the principal focus of the central bank authorities, or of those who study and try to assess and interpret central bank policy. The objectives of the central bank incorporate the price level, the level of economic activity, the functioning and solvency of the banking system, the adjustment process whereby the economy seeks and finds its real exchange rate equilibrium, the stability and viability of credit markets, and so on. Looking at the balance sheet of the consolidated banking system brings one much closer to these matters than looking at the mere balance sheet of the central bank.<br>Put another way, M2 may or may not itself be an objective of central bank policy, but even if M2 is looked upon as an instrument, it is an instrument that is much closer to the deeper objectives of central bank policy than is H. My own view is that, if something serious goes wrong at the level of the balance sheet of the consolidated banking system, that is part of the responsibility of the central bank, even though it can operate only indirectly on the components of the consolidated balance sheet. The items on the central bank’s own balance sheet should be looked on mainly as instruments to allow the bank to fulfill its deeper responsibilities.</p>
<p>With such a capital market, increased government demand for loanable funds will lead to a rise in the relevant pattern of interest rates, drawing out additional supplies from the various sources of funds, but also, and very important, displacing demand from the productive sector of the economy. In this process, funds are bid away from the productive sector of the economy, and investment there ends up being lower than it would otherwise be. This process of productive investment being displaced as a consequence of government demand for funds has come to be known as ‘crowding out.’ Quite obviously, the economic growth of a country will suffer to the extent that crowding out takes place.</p>
<p>The degree of crowding out depends greatly on the nature of the rising supply curve of funds from abroad. If it is very elastic, increments in demand for funds will largely be met by new supplies from abroad, and there will be little crowding out. If the curve is very inelastic, and the local supply of loanable funds is also, most of the funds raised by the government will come at the expense of displaced productive investments.</p>
<p>For some countries well integrated into the world capital market, the supply curve of foreign funds has a relatively modest upward slope. In such countries, even when the government does not directly sell its bonds abroad, the sale of bonds in the home market sucks in capital from abroad to such an extent that most of the deficit is effectively financed in this way.</p>
<p>The smaller the degree of integration of a country with the world capital market, the less elastic the supply curve of foreign funds that it faces is likely to be, hence the higher the degree of crowding out caused by government deficits. In the last decade or two, several Latin American countries, most recently Mexico, have experienced real interest rates as high as 2 or 3 percent a month. Such interest rates signal a situation in which the world capital market cannot be counted on as a ready source of incremental supplies of funds.</p>
<p>For those lucky countries that face quite elastic supply curves of foreign funds, crowding out is not an immediate problem. Going into debt now postpones the moment when citizens must ‘pay a price’ for today’s government expenditure. This aspect is always present when the government goes into debt and can easily give rise to deep moral issues connected with passing fiscal burdens on to future generations. So-called populist governments in many different countries have taken the easy road, according benefits to their citizens far beyond their capacity and the citizens’ willingness to pay. Although they can succeed temporarily in this ‘miracle’ simply by accumulating debt, ultimately the price must be paid – a fact that up to now has doomed populist governments to failure.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the course of wisdom and responsibility for governments the world over is to rely as little as possible on deficit financing of any kind. This allows maximum scope for the channeling of the available savings of the economy into productive investments, and it maintains the integrity of government and the society vis-a-vis future generations.</p>

        <p>An economic problem exists whenever scarce means are used to satisfy alternative ends.<br>If the means are not scarce, there is no problem at all; there is Nirvana. If the means are scarce but there is only a single end, the problem of how to use the means is a technological problem. No value judgements enter into its solution; only knowledge of physical and technical relationships.</p>
<p>Knight points out in his Economic Organization, the economic problem may be subdivided into five interrelated problems:<br>1) fixing standards<br>2) organizing production<br>3) distributing the product<br>4) providing for economic maintenance and progress<br>5) adjusting consumption to production over short periods</p>
<p>In a free-enterprise exchange economy this task is accomplished essentially through voting, voting in the market place with dollars.</p>
<p>Prices of products in relation to the costs of producing them determine the distribution of resources among industries; the relative prices of factors, in turn, determine the coordination of factors within industries.</p>
<p>Prices thus serve as guideposts to where resources are wanted most, and, in addition, prices provide the incentive for people to follow these guideposts.</p>
<p>Prices, therefore, do three kinds of things in solving the above firve problems.<br>They transmit information effectively and efficiently;<br>they provide an incentive to users of resources to be guided by this information;<br>and they provide in incentive to owners of resources to follow this information.</p>
<p>There is the problem of over-simplification and the problem that description always sounds like justification.<br>The problem solved by a price system is an extremely complicated one, involving the coordination of the activities of tens and hundreds of millions of people all over the globe and their prompt adjustement to ever-changing conditions.  The price system is an extremely subtle and complex device for solving this problem.<br>Casual observation of the world leads to an underestimation of the complexity of both the problem and the device used to solve it, because insofar as the price system works we are hardly conscious of its workings. The conplexities are brought to our attention only when something goes wrong.<br>Similarly, a summary description necssarily involves over-simplification, emphasis on the highlights and neglect of not unimportant details. </p>
<p>In any normative judgement of the price system on the basis of the preceding description, several things must be kept in mind.<br>First, this description implicitly supposes the existence of effective competition in translating consumer wishes into productive activity. It is assumed that people can affect their incomes only through use of their resources and not through interference with the price system. There is freedom to compete but not freedom to combine.<br>Second, the controlling force is pecuniary demand; voting is in proportion to the number of dollars a person had. This is not obviously ‘just’. The basic inequality, it should be noted, is an inequality in the ownership of resources. What the market does is primarily to determine the return per unit of resource, and there is no reason to believe that the market aggravates the inequality in the ownership of resources.<br>Moreover, any given degree of inequality is a much more serious one in an economy which is governed largely by status or tradition than in a market economy where there is much chance for shifts in the ownership of resources. Historically, the fundamental inequality of economic status has been and is almost certainly greater in economies that do not rely on the free market than in those that do.</p>
<p>The economist has little to say about the formation of wants; this is the province of the psychologist. The econmist’s task is to trace the consequences of any given set of wants.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the word ‘demand’ will be used only when reference is being made to the demand schedule; and the words ‘quantity demanded’ will be used when reference is being make to a particular quantity.</p>
<p>At point A (equalibrium point) the underlying forces of demand and supply, not demand and supply themselves, have established a price which equates the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded.</p>
<p>The more inelastic the demand curve the greater will be the fluctuation in price due to a given change in quantity supplied.</p>
<p>In the shortest of all runs, where conditions are allowed to vary very little, one would expect the demand curve to have the least elasticity. As the range of conditions which are allowed to vary is widened, one would expect the elasticity of the demand curve to increase.</p>
<p>The theoretical explanation offered for the backward bending segment of the supply curve is that a rise in the real wage rate arising from an increased demand for labor has two effects: (1) It makes leisure more expensive, since the cost of an hour of leisure is the wage that could be earned in that hour. This is the substitution effect, and by itself would tend to raise the number of hours worked. (2) If the individual were to work the same number of hours, the rise in the real wage rate increases his real income, which would lead him to want to purchase more of various kinds of goods, including leisure. This is the income effect, and by itself would tend to reduce the number of hours worked unless leisure is an inferior good.</p>
<p>It therefore follows that on the margin everything is equally necessary or equally unnecessary.</p>
<p>The elasticity of demand will depend primarily on the availability of substitutes. Consequently, the more narrowly defined is the comodity in question, the more substitutes will be available and the greater the elasticity of demand for the commodity. Thus the elasticity of demand for white bread is greater than the elasticity of demand for bread.</p>
<p>Consider the following, each of which is sometimes included in ceteris paribus:<br>1) Prices of all other products<br>2) Quantities of all other products<br>3) Money income or money expenditures of consumers</p>
<p>It (‘Walrasian’ function) is an extremely useful abstract conception to bring out the logic of the interrelation of the price system; it cannot be used to analyze a concrete problem.</p>
<p>Diminishing marginal utility will provide a negative slope for the demand curve, but the fact that the demand curve has a negative slope does not require diminishing marginal utility.</p>
<p>The slope of the indifference curve is the rate of substitution in consumption.<br>The slope of the budget line represents the rate of substitution in purchase.<br>This budget line does not necessarily have to be a straight line.</p>
<p>A good is said to be a superior good if the quantity consumed increases as income increases and an inferior good if the quantity consumed decreases as income increases.</p>
<p>Income elasticity is frequently used to define the terms ‘necessities’ and ‘luxuries’. A good is termed a ‘necessity’ if its income elasticity is less than unity, a ‘luxury’ if its income elasticity is greater than unity.</p>
