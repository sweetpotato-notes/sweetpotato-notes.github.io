        <p>It is generally agreed that increases in labour productivity are the only long run source of growth in living standards. And since Solow (1956) a wide though not universal consensus has existed that behind the growth of labour productivity stands the growth of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Without continuing TFP growth there can be no growth in labour productivity since capital accumulation by itself would be subject to diminishing returns. But what are the sources of TFP growth? The literature (surveyed by Hulten (2001)) suggests that measured TFP growth can arise in one or more of the following ways:<br>(1) From technical and scientific progress (including improvements in management techniques). This does not include progress embodied in new or improved types of capital or which is purchased directly via for example consultancy. Only progress which comes for free is to be included here.<br>(2) From learning effects, either learning by doing or learning from others, or more broadly from externalities and economies of scale.<br>(3) By reallocation of inputs towards more (or less) productive uses, either at the firm or the industry level.<br>(4) As an artefact of measurement error (as when increases in the quality of human or physical capital are wrongly ignored or output is mismesured) or when some types of asset (such as intangible) are wrongly omitted.</p>
<p>The fact that industry TFP growth rates differ suggests adding a fifth source of TFP growth at the aggregate level:<br>(5) Shifts in the structure of output and demand leading to changes in the aggregate growth rate of TFP and hence of aggregate labour productivity. These shifts could be favourable or unfavourable to growth.</p>
<p>The EU KLEMS dataset has two great strengths. First, it is consistent with the national accounts of the countries included. Second, it goes beyond the national accounts by using a common methodology for estimating labour quality and capital services. Furthermore, labour quality and capital services are estimated in a disaggregated manner: 18 types of labour (distinguished by educational attainment (three types), sex (two types) and age (three groups)) and seven types of capital asset (three in ICT (computers, communication equipment, and software) and four in non-ICT (transport equipment, other machinery and equipment, non-residential structures, other) assets). Labour input is measured by hours worked, not number of workers.</p>
<p>These criticisms are not meant to disparage micro-level studies, just to point out that the data on which they are based do not dominate empirically the data behind industry-level studies. So micro-level studies should be seen as complements to, not substitutes for, industry-level ones.</p>
<p>he analysis to follow is confined to the market sector and its constituent 10 industries for two reasons. First, the measurement of real output in the non-market industry groups is problematic and likely inconsistent across countries. Second, since most of the non-market industries are publicly-owned, the motivations of decision makers are probably not focused on cost minimization or profit maximization, thus calling into question the growth accounting methodology.</p>
<p>Negative TFP growth suggests firms in these industries are becoming less efficient over time or that technical knowledge is being forgotten, which seems highly implausible in peaceful conditions. Negative growth may be explicable in some cases. For instance in mining and quarrying deposits may be becoming harder to extract as they are progressively worked out. In electricity, gas and water an increasing burden of environmental regulation might be the cause: the costs of meeting the regulations are measured but the benefits in terms of lower emissions are not included in output. These explanations do not seem to apply to construction or hotels and restaurants and still less to business services which as we shall see is one of the sectors to which resources are shifting in all countries.</p>
<p>Hence one must suspect measurement errors, as already noted by Timmer et al. (2010) in the case of business services. If measurement error is present the first place to look is errors in output measurement. It is well known that price indices for private services are poorly developed by contrast to those for industrial products (though even those are not beyond reproach as discussed below). It is quite plausible that the relative prices of sophisticated services like legal and advertising services or software are falling but that this is not picked up by the deflators actually used (often the GDP deflator or the CPI).</p>
<p>The clearest pattern is seen in business services whose share has been rising in every country. This means that in most countries resources have been shifting away from agriculture and manufacturing, where TFP growth is apparently at its most rapid, towards in particular business services where TFP growth is measured as negative.</p>
<p>Assuming marginal cost pricing and that a given input receives the same price in all industries, the Solow residual in a multi-industry setting is interpretable as a measure of the outward shift of the production possibility frontier made possible by technological change, with all inputs (including intermediate ones) held constant (Hulten, 1978; Gabaix, 2011).</p>
<p>The aggregation result reveals that aggregate TFP growth depends not only on the industry-level TFP growth rates but also on the pattern of demand embodied in the set of Domar weights. This means that structual change - that is, change in the pattern of demand across industries – can lead to changes in aggregate TFP growth even with no change in any industry level rate of TFP growth. A well known example of this phenomenon is the cost disease model of Baumol (1967). Suppose that over time consumer demand is shifting towards final demand services, such as entertainment, health and education, which have low productivity growth. Everything else being equal, this shift of resources toward industries with relatively low TFP growth reduces aggregate TFP growth.</p>
<p>This add a new source of aggregate TFP growth that is different from those usually considered. Even if industry-level TFP growth were the same across industries and constant over time, an increase in the degree of outsourcing in the economy (reflected in an increase in the sum of the Domar weights) would result in an increase in aggregate TFP growth.</p>
<p>So we have reached the paradoxical conclusion that the aggregate TFP growth rate can rise even if resources are shifting towards industries with lower productivity growth, provided these industries are selling intermediate and not final products (and provided that TFP growth in these industries is positive; if it is negative, then outsourcing will reduce aggregate TFP growth). Intuitively, productivity growth in industries that produce intermediate inputs contributes indirectly to the output of the final goods industries that buy those intermediates, and it is the output of final goods that is relevant for aggregate productivity growth. Outsourcing (i.e. an increase in the value added share of intermediate input producers) increases the size of this contribution, even with the industry level productivity growth rates held constant. Oulton (2001) provides a more fulsome discussion of the intuition behind this result.</p>
<p>The effect of structural change is seen to be predominantly negative. Only 5 out of the 18 countries show a possitive effect: the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland and Sweden. The unweighted cross-country mean of the change is -0.13 per cent per year. Arithmetically, the reason for this is clear: in all countries resources have been shifting to business services but in this sector TFP growth is almost invariably estimated to be negative. So any shift of resources towards this sector will seemingly have reduced the aggregate growth rate (it will make an increasingly negative contribution to the Domar-weighted sum).</p>
<p>All this is for the aggregate economy. But the errors in TFP measurement are likely to be larger at the industry level. The reason is that most industries are users but not producers of capital goods. So there are no offsetting errors on the output side to at least partially cancel out the input side error and so reduce the TFP error. This means that TFP growth in capital goods producing industries is likely to be understated and in other industries overstated.</p>
<p>It is possible that whole classes of capital assets have been omitted from the growth accounting calculations because they have been misclassified as intermediate inputs. This argument was first raised in regard to software and R&amp;D. In this case the argument was accepted and expenditures on software and R&amp;D are now recognized as forms of investment in the System of National Accounts (SNA); software but not R&amp;D appears as an investment in EU KLEMS. It has also been argued that there is a whole range of other expenditures, dubbed intangible investment, which should also be reclassified as investment. These include expenditures on building organizational capital, in-house training, and design and marketing. These expenditures have not yet been accepted as investment in the SNA. But changing in SNA is a lengthy process and it is quite possible that some or all of these expenditures will be in a future SNA revision.</p>
<p>But how then do we decide how much of measured TFP growth should be attributed to increasing variety and how much to the other sources? One response is that we should revise the measure of capital to take explicit account of the increasing (or for that matter decreasing) variety of capital types, whether human or physical. After all, the proximate source of productivity growth in the Romer model is more capital though not more of the same capital. And it is now generally accepted by NSIs that investment and capital should allow for increasing quality. So why not also for increasing variety? This is the approach suggested by Feenstra and Markusen (1992). But to apply their method it is necessary to know the range of inputs in every period and the expenditures on each. It is also necessary to know (or estimate) the elasticity of substitution between varieties. At the moment this makes the approach impractical on a large scale. But in principle it could be used to allocte measured TFP growth between increased variety and other sources.</p>
<p>The previous section considered whether capital services are generally mismeasured and if so what is the likely size of the resulting error in TFP growth. Another possibility is that even if capital is correctly measured its impact may not be. In other words, the elasticity of output with respect to capital may exceed capital’s share. This could be because of economies of scale. But at the industry level such economies seem likely to be important in only a few industries where a square-cube law prevails, such as pipeline or electricity generation. A more plausible reason is network externality effects as a new technology such as the Internet is deployed. Another is learning by doing arising from capital investment, either within the firm or by follower firms learning from early adopters.</p>
<p>We can also test the hypothesis that the capital elasticity exceeds capital’s share econometrically. We can regress the growth of output per hour on the growth of capital per hour and check whether the coefficient on capital differs significantly from capital’s share. This approach runs into well-known econometric difficulties since capital growth is likely correlated with the error term which includes TFP. Nevertheless, a model was estimated in which the current growth of labour productivity in the market sector depends on its own lagged growth rate and on the growth rate of capital per hour plus country and year controls. Both lagged productivity growth and capital per hour growth were highly significant. When estimated by OLS the long run capital elasticity was 0.42 and its was 0.40 when using the Arellano-Bond method. This is higher than the actual capital shares shown in Table 3 but not high enough to eliminate TFP as a source of growth.</p>
<p>In summary, we have seen that any attempt to eliminate TFP from the growth story and replace it with some wider or better measure of capital seems unlikely to succeed. But we still have much to learn about TFP. Given the importance to TFP in growth theory and current fears of a pervasive growth slowdown (e.g. Cowen 2011; Gordon 2016), it is depressing that so much of the discussion still needs to be about measurement error. This is not the fault of the data compliers who are doing their best with limited resources. But though policy-makers everywhere are concerned about these issues, they are generally unwilling to devote the (quite limited) additional resources needed for improved measurement to advance understanding. Until this changes the mystery of TFP is likely to remain unresolved.</p>
