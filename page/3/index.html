        <p>The economic consequences of learning-by-doing, the hypothesis that unit costs decrease with cumulative production, are well known. In industrial organization, learning-by-doing can rationalize pricing below short-run marginal cost and lead to increases in industry concentration through the emergence of a low-cost dominant firm (Spence 1981; Cabral and Riodan 1994; Benkard 2004; Besanko et al. 2010). In macroeconomics, on-the-job learning and knowledge spillovers are widely believed to play important roles in driving endogenous economic growth (Arrow 1962; Lucas 1988; Stokey 1988; Parente 1994; Jovanovic and Nyarko 1996). This article uses a new data set to document a form of learning that has thus for received little attention: relationship-specific learning. Learning-by-doing can be relationship-specific when the productivity improvements associated with the accumulation of experience are specific to not just an individual firm but to pairs of firms working together in a contracting relationship. For example, a contract accounting firm may improve the speed with which it prepares a client’s quarterly reports as its employees become familiar with the client’s personnel and accounts.</p>
<p>Relationship-specific learning is consequential because it implies that relationship stability is important to productivity. When two firms accumulate experience working together, relationship-specific intellectual capital is created that cannot be appropriated to pairings with other firms. If the relationship is broken, this capital is destroyed and productivity decreases. Relationship-specific learning therefore gives firms an incentive to work with contractors with which they have substantial experience, rather than those with which they have worked relatively little. This learning may also be a mechanism behind recent documentation of forgetting efects. Argote, Beckman, and Epple (1990), Benkard (2000), and Thompson (2007) find evidence that a firm’s recent production experience has a stronger impact on productivity than does older experience. Some of this experience depreciation may reflect an unobserved change in the firm’s contracting relationships and a commensurate loss of relationship-specific capital. Finally, like forgetting, relationship-specific learning may be important at the macroeconomic level: recessions that disrupt production and fracture relationships may result in a productivity decrease that persists beyond the rebound in output during the recovery.</p>
<p>This article’s primary finding is that not only do producers and rigs learn from their own experience, they also benefit from relationship-specific learning. Specifically, a rig that works with only one producer will, on average, benefit from productivity improvements more than twice as large as those of a rig that frequently changes producers. Because I observe multiple wells drilled per producer - rig pair, I am able to use producer-rig fixed effects to distinguish this learning effect from any ex ante match specificities that might cause certain firm pairs to drill more effectively and more frequently than others.</p>
<p>For the average well in my data set, I estimate that relationship-specific learning reduces drilling times by 4.9% on average, yielding cost savings of about $12,400 per well. These savings give firms an incentive to maintain long-term relationships. Accordingly, the data indicate that producers prefer to work with rigs with which they have worked little. I find that this contracting pattern is difficult to explain with switching costs or ex ante match specificities alone.</p>
<p>Finally, I examine the mechanism behind the observed relationship-specific learning. Although these results are empirically weaker than the primary finding, the learning appears to be driven primarily by the accumulation of personal interactions between the firms’ personnel rather than rigs’ accumulation of geologic or technical knowledge specific to the wells they drill for their producers. Consistent with this result, I find that firms tend to choose a contractual form that increases cross firm personal contacts when they anticipate working together for an extended period of time - a situation in which maximizing the rate of relationship-specific learning is particularly important.</p>
<p>It is natural to ask why this industry is vertically separated, particularly given the relationship-specific learning effects identified in this article. The answer lies in the spatial and temporal variation with which producers drill wells. The drilling activity of any producer fluctuates with oil production outcomes from recently drilled wells and the firm’s success in finding new fields. Successful wildcats and development wells often lead to additional drilling, whereas ‘dry’ unproductive holes do not. The mobility and nonspecificity of rigs allow them to smooth these fluctuations in drilling requirements across producers. This smoothing minimizes overall rig capacity requirements, as well as rig transportation and mobilization costs, without requiring the producers to contract directly with each other.</p>
<p>Corts and Singh (2004) empirically examine the determinants of contract type in the offshore drilling industry and verify several intuitive theoretical predictions. For example, dayrate contracts are used more frequently in situations in which there is a large amount of geologic uncertainty because producers are better equipped with the knowledge and technical staff to address geologic risk. The choice of contractual form also affects drilling performance incentives. Under a footage contract, the rig will have a direct monetary incentive to exert a high level of effort and drill quickly, but this incentive will not exist under a dayrate contract. Rig reputations are well known by producers, and rigs known to have effective, experienced crews can command a dayrate premium over other rigs. Also, because the producer’s company man is present on the rig on a dayrate contract, he can observe the efforts of the rig foreman and crew. In an environment in which repeat contracting is common, this observability of effort can generate implicit performance incentives for the contractor (Corts 2007).</p>
