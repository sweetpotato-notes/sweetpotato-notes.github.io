        <p>For the core of my concern here is regulatory strategy: how the regulators themselves framed or failed to frame their purposes, and how they executed those purposes or failed to do so. In the language of administrative science, I am interested in both the formulation and implementation of policy. But policy remains a work of man.</p>
<p>In the last hundred years, there have been four periods when regulation as a whole took on enhanced importance: the 1870s, the early years of industrializtion; the period 1900-1916, often called the Progressive Era; the 1930s, during the New Deal; and the 1970s, when both regulation and deregulation somehow grew simultaneously.</p>
<p>In nearly every article, he (Charles Francis Adams) made four theme explicit.</p>
<ol>
<li>Industrialization in America had acquired a momentum of its own, a thrust and direction essentially independent of human will. Technology was shaping society as it had never done before.</li>
<li>This technological determinism applied not only to the general aspects of the case, but especially to one industry – the railroads – whose unique economics of natural monopoly sharply restricted governments’ choices in making policy.</li>
<li>A serious institutional lag had opened up between corporate development and the public response to it. As a consquence, private and public interests were out of balance.</li>
<li>The best solution to the ‘railroad problem’ (as contemporary writers called it) was not really a solution in the final sense, but rather some means of coping with a situation that was inherently fluid and complex. To perform this function, a new instrumentality of government must be created: an expert, permanent, apolitical body – in brief, a regulatory commission.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the beginning, railroads exhibited almost unlimited economies of scale. And Charles Francis Adam’s fascination with this remarkable characteristic infused all of his early writings on the industry. ‘It is an undisputed law of railway economics,’ he observed with excitement, ‘that the cost of the movement is in direct inverse ratio to the amount moved.’ But the implications is in direct inverse ratio to the amount moved’ But the implications of scale reached beyond mere academic interest and even beyond the balance sheets of individual companies. They went as well to the very heart of the railroad problem. For if scale economies were sufficiently great, then competition in the accepted sense of the word simply did not apply. The basic premise of an direct inverse ratio of cost to traffic, Adams wrote, pointed directly to ‘a conclusion which is at the basis of the whole transportation problem: competition and the cheaptest possible transportation are wholly incompatible.’</p>
<p>With public ownership disqualified for practical reasons and monopoly unacceptable on ideological grounds, only one alternative remained: enforced competition among railroads. This policy, Adams reported with regret, had been followed dogmatically in Massachusetts. Though it worked well in regulating most industries, it had brought nothing but grief for the railroads.</p>
