        <p>According to the modern theory of institutions, two factors are critical to the performance of an economic system: the information held by the various actors and their incentives. Yet in the past and even in our times, scholars have frequently ignored these factors in their proposals for reform.</p>
<p>Barone’s vision of the fundamental issues of an economic system has been shared by many scholars in the twentieth century. In the 1930s the famous Lange-Lerner blueprint of a managed economy envisioned a system of ‘market socialism’ where a central planning bureau (CPB) balanced supply and demand by using a trial-and-error method to set prices. The managers of the state-owned enterprises were to be given instructions hailing from Econ IOI: (a) pick a combination of productive factors that minimize average costs and (b) set marginal costs equal to the prices determined by the CPB. Similarly, many economists in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as well as in the West, believed that the advent of powerful computers would enable central planners and programmers to solve Barone’s equations and provide a scientific solution to the economic problem.</p>
<p>Many of these proposed reforms were based on a notion of the optimal allocation of resources, which was seen as existing independently of economic systems. The scholars then proposed new institutional arrangements intended to alingn society with their models and bring economic systems closer to the theoretical optimum. Generally, the proposed reforms emphasized static rather than dynamic efficiency and ignored technological change, as might be expected of theories that deemphasized knowledge and information.</p>
<p>Not all economists agreed with this worldview. Probably the best known of the early critics were the Austrian economists. In 1920, Ludwig von Mises denied the possibility of rational economic calculations under socialism because important information required to make such calculations would be lacking. According to von Mises, a market based on private ownership of the means of production provides at low cost vital information that would be unavailable in a system where the means of production are not individually owned and traded. Another Austrian scholar, Friedrich Hayek, wrote extensively on the role of information in economic systems and made a pioneering contribution to the economics of institutions and the information revolution in economics.</p>
<p>In a world of costly information, contracts between principals and agents are necessarily incomplete and the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard are likely to emerge. For the actors involved, the extent of these problems depends on the institutional arrangements and various other aspects of their environment. Adverse selection occurs when contractual relations are established and is caused by the high cost to a contracting party of measuring accurately what the other side has to offer, with measurement being necessarily incomplete and, as a consequence, being frequently by proxy. When managers were hired in the Soviet system, much weight was given (for good reason) to outward signs of loyalty to the regime. However, the evidence suggests that unscrupulous, opportunistic, and incompetent persons paraded signs of loyalty in the hope of obtaining good positions. Moral hazard arises during contractual relations because it is too costly for one side to a contract to accurately measure the performance of the other side, which creates opportunities for cheating. The central managers of the Soviet system were not able to specify, monitor, or enforce quality at all valueable margins of each planned commodity. Instead, they issued a general description of the planned products and watched select margins such as quantity or weight, creating an opportunity for producers to ignore unmeasured qualitative margins. As would be expected, the resulting goods and services were usually of low quality.</p>
<p>Clearly and unequivocally it is the apparatchiks and bureaucrats of STEs who gain most from maintaining the institutional status quo, and they are the groups which resist change most strongly. Given the key positions of these groups in the STE system, we may predict a very high probability of failure of decentralizing, market-oriented, efficiency increasing reforms.</p>
<p>In comparative terms, acute economic crises can be handled more easily in market economies with a representative government than in Soviet-type economies with pre-representative governments. If one uses Schumpeter’s term, ‘creative destruction,’ to characterize positive innovative behavior stimulated by crisis in representative market economies, one should, in parallel, use the term ‘destructive destruction’ to identify crisis-induced behaviro is STEs.</p>
<p>Despite the pessimistic analyses offered in this article, one should not conclude that economic reforms in STEs will inevitably fail. Reforms, it is true, are much more difficult to achieve there than in other predatory states, largely because of the unique interface between the political and economic spheres in STEs. However, under certain conditions of long term economic decline, such as apparently affected all East European STEs in the 1980s, political changes may positively affect the chances for the success of economic changes (see Bauer [1984] and Winiecki [1984a]; 1986).</p>
