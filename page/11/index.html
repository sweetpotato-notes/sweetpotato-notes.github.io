        <p>High leverage and soaring housing prices have recently caused wide concerns about the risks and instability of China’s financial system. Figure 1 plots the ratio of the total outstanding debt (excluding central government debt) to GDP. By the end of 2015, the total debt stood above 20 trillion USD, with an annual growth rate of 20% since 2008. The debt-GDP ratio, which was slightly above 1.2 in 2008, skyrocketed to 2.1 in 2015. The high leverage is associated with enormous appreciation in housing prices. In 2003–2013, housing prices in real terms grew at an annual real rate of 13.1% in the first-tier cities, 10.5% in the second-tier cities, and 7.9% in the third-tier cities (Fang, Gu, Xiong, and Zhou, 2015). Despite the recent strict measures to cool down the housing market, including a requirement of a 50% to 70% down payment on second homes and tight restrictions on third homes in big cities, housing prices continue to grow at a disturbingly fast pace.</p>
<p>There are also concerns about other sectors in the financial system. The 2015 stock market crash wiped out 3 trillion USD in share value. Despite the government’s rescue plan to buy more than one trillion RMB worth of shares, the market has shown lackluster performance ever since. China accumulated almost 4 trillion USD in foreign reserves by 2014. Capital flight has become a serious issue since then. Foreign reserves of 1 trillion USD were lost in 2015 and 2016. The net capital outflow amounted to 1.5 trillion USD in these two years. A mild but sudden depreciation of the Chinese yuan occurred in August 2015. In 2016, the Chinese yuan depreciated by 10% against the USD and by 15% against a basket of currencies weighted by trade. Although the exchange rate has been stabilized recently, it came at a cost of much tighter capital controls.</p>
<p>To systematically assess these financial risks, it is necessary to anchor the assessment on China’s unique economic structure that led to the current financial system. China started its economic transition in the late 1970s. A dual-track or gradualist approach has been adopted to tackle the fundamental issues inherited from the central planning regime, such as the soft budget constraint syndrome a la Kornai (1979, 1980), that go hand in hand with a large but inefficient state sector. Although these problems have never been fully solved, they were greatly mitigated until 2008. Economic liberalization in the 1980s led to a booming private sector. The state sector was consolidated by “Grasp the Large, Let Go of the Small” started in the mid-1990s. Local government budgets were tightened by the 1994 tax sharing reform and the 1995 Budget Law. A set of new rules and regulations were introduced to make commercial banks more independent after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Consequently, investment went up, resource allocation improved and growth took off (see, e.g., Zhu (2012) and Zilibotti (2017)).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the trend was reversed in the post-2008 period. China was hit hard by the 2008 world financial crisis: GDP growth decreased from 15% in 2007 to 10% in 2008 and then 8% in 2009 (see the dotted line in Figure 2). In response, the State launched a massive four trillion yuan stimulus plan in late 2008. While the stimulus boosted investment (see the solid line in Figure 2), it came at a cost of compromising some fiscal and financial institutional arrangements that were established to contain the problems such as the soft budget constraints (Bai, Hsieh and Song, 2016). As we will elaborate below, the economic stimulus worsened the soft budget constraint problem and reversed the flow of resources between the state and private sectors. Local government financing vehicles and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) increased their investment but crowded out more efficient private investment. While the aggregate investment did increase, misallocation worsened and growth slowed. Figure 2 shows that investment and growth used to comove closely before 2008. After 2008, they started to depart from each other. The investment rate increased to unprecedented levels above 45%, while the growth rate fell to 7%. Accordingly, aggregate TFP growth and returns to capital dropped dramatically (Bai and Zhang, 2015).</p>
<p>Such retreat reveals an important mission of China’s financial system—it was largely developed to support the dual-track reform. State-owned commercial banks were reformed and guided to fund mostly SOEs. The State established the stock market in the early 1990s for two key purposes: (1) channeling private savings to SOEs; and (2) diversifying risks in the state-owned banking sector (see, e.g., Wong, 2006). The development of the bond market is no different. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) since 2002, acknowledged that “administrative allocation of quotas (for bond issuance) was often used as a relief measure for financially distressed enterprises” (Zhou, 2006). The subsequent rapid development of the financial markets has never fixed this problem. In today’s China, the State has loosened its direct controls of the financial system and financial supports have been extended to private businesses. Nevertheless, credit allocation favors SOEs and other connected private firms through explicit or implicit guarantees by the government. Moreover, a softer budget constraint intensifies<br>favoritism which, in turn, entrenches the soft budget constraint problem. This can be seen by the recent dramatic increase in the debt of local governments and listed firms, most of which are SOEs and connected private firms (Bai, Hsieh, and Song, 2016).</p>
<p>While the risks are concerning, we argue that they are unlikely to lead China to the same kind of financial crises experienced by western countries. First of all, the Chinese State controls a lot of resources through local governments, the banking system, SOEs, and the connected private firms. Although SOEs remain less efficient than private firms, the restructuring since the late 1990s has greatly improved the viability of the state sector, which was on the verge of collapse<br>back then. Some SOEs even became highly profitable by establishing monopolistic positions in “strategic” industries. Second, Chinese households have high saving rates and low leverage levels. The economy runs a sizable trade surplus and does not have much external debt. The financial sector is dominated by state-owned commercial banks. These provide flexibility for the State to steer through difficult times. Third, the rising leverage is mostly from state-owned banks to local governments, SOEs, and other connected private firms. This relationship makes it relatively easy for the State to resolve the coordination problem between creditors, as well as any externality in restructuring debt, and thus to avoid inefficient and costly bankruptcies that typically occur in financial crises.</p>
<p>That said, we argue that the distortions in the dual-track system may cause a vicious circle that leads to more policy distortions, lowers economic growth, and lead to more financial risks in the long run. The recent firm data has shown signs of deteriorating allocation efficiency.</p>
<p>Misallocation among Chinese industrial firms increased by 20% (Bai, Hsieh, and Song, 2016) from 2008 to 2013. Preliminary estimates from Brandt, Wang, and Zhang (2017) also suggest a significant decline in TFP in most two-digit industrial sectors after 2007. The real estate boom across China also exacerbated the capital allocation inefficiency among industrial firms (Chen,Liu, Xiong, and Zhou, 2017). There is also a large policy risk. The financial system is becoming increasingly complex and cannot be handled with the traditional approach of “crossing the river by touching the stone.” Policies and regulations can deliver unintended consequences, some of which may be even counter-productive, e.g., Hachem and Song (2016, 2017), Cai et al. (2017), Chen et al. (2017) and Chen, Petukhov, and Wang (2017). Such risks are further exacerbated by speculation about government intervention (see e.g., Brunnermeier, Sockin, and Xiong (2017a, 2017b)).</p>
<p>The economic reform that the Chinese government started in early 1980s has led to spectacular economic growth during the past 35 years; the average annual growth rate has been nearly 10% and hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. At the core of the reform was a dual-track approach that allows the co-existence of SOEs and private businesses. The success of the economic reform has proved several important advantages of this dual-track approach. First, it supports gradualism. As we will elaborate below, by continuing to support SOEs, the dual-track approach avoided a sudden collapse of the state sector, and the likely consequence of massive unemployment and social instability. For this reason, the dual-track approach is also referred to as a “reform without losers.” By minimizing the political resistance to private business, the dual-track approach has given birth to more than 20 million of private firms. In addition, the dual-track approach nurtured “crony capitalism with Chinese characteristics” (Bai, Hsieh, and Song, in progress). Many private firms are closely connected with local governments, which helps remove entry barriers, cuts red tape, and offers financial support. In fact, China’s phenomenal growth largely has been driven by the growth of private businesses (see e.g., Song et al., 2011; Brandt et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Second, the boom of the private sector forced the State to improve the efficiency of SOEs and to tighten their soft budget constraints. The restructuring of the state sector was conducted under the slogan of “Grasp the Large, Let Go of the Small”— i.e., shutting down or privatizing small SOEs and corporatizing big SOEs. The transformation was successful to the extent that big SOEs improved their productivity relative to their private counterparts (Hsieh and Song, 2015). More important, fiscal decentralization was replaced with centralization by the 1994 tax sharing reform, the Budget Law and other policies and regulations. The central government is able to effectively control and allocate key resources in the economy, such as natural resources, public utilities, transportation, telecommunication, and finance through the SOEs (Lin, Cai, and Li, 1998). With its ability to mobilize these important resources, the Chinese government has an unparalleled capacity to implement its economic policies such as investment in large capital intensive infrastructure projects to upgrade roads, bridges, highways, airports, and ports throughout the country. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the dual-track approach also comes with remarkable downsides. A key concern is that the protection of SOEs nurtures vested interests, which, in turn, blocks further reforms. Since 2008, the size of the state sector has stabilized at a level around 30% of the industrial sector, and the TFP convergence between SOEs and private firms has also stopped, with the capital productivity of SOEs remaining at roughly half of that of private firms (Hsieh and Song, 2015). The state sector is even bigger in service industries, where misallocation is also significantly more severe (see Ge, Luo, Song and Yang, 2017). </p>
<p>In contrast to what one would have expected, the financial system served mainly to support the inefficient state sector rather than funding the booming private sector. The banking system was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by splitting the commercial banking businesses of the People’s Bank of China into four state-owned commercial banks: Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, Construction Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. These state banks provided disproportional amounts of bank loans to support ailing SOEs and suffered enormous capital losses in the 1990s and the early 2000s. With the banking system<br>substantially limited by its bad loans, the stock market was created in the early 1990s to provide another funding source for the SOEs, as well as a mechanism to reform their governance, e.g., Allen and Shen (2012) and Allen, Qian, and Gu (2017). The two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen primarily listed SOEs in the early years; it only started to list private firms recently. The two bond markets, one interbank market established in 1996 and the other exchange market established in 2007, also favor bonds issued by local governments and SOEs (see e.g., Borst and Lardy, 2015). As we will elaborate below, the special mission of the financial system to support SOEs has had profound impacts on both efficiency and risks of the financial system. In particular, it made the financial system heavily exposed to the problems of SOEs.</p>
<p>Soft budget constraint is a term originated from Kornai’s study of centrally planned and transition economies. It can arise in many circumstances due to the lack of commitment not to support the BC-organization (i.e., the organization has a budget constraint) by the S-organization (i.e., the organization ready to cover deficits of the BC-organization). In the context of China, SOEs enjoy a soft budget constraint as the government lacks the commitment to liquidate losing SOEs. Soft budget constraint per se is a powerful explanation for the low efficiency of the state sector. The soft budget constraint, provided by the government through explicit and implicit subsidies, is also a cornerstone for the asymmetry in access to financial resources between SOEs and private firms, which has been vital to the survival of SOEs.</p>
<p>The favoritism for SOEs is ubiquitous in China’s financial system. For instance, SOEs can borrow at regulated interest rates and go public with priority, while most private firms have to rely on internal financing or borrow from informal channels at much higher interest rates (Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005). The responsibility of the state banks to support the soft budget constraint of the SOEs has also been a key source of bad loans for state banks in the 1990s and the early 2000s. Consequently, there is a large and persistent gap of returns to capital between SOEs and private firms. Capital allocation is severely distorted (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Hsieh and Song, 2015; Song and Wu, 2015).</p>
<p>All the major commercial banks are state-owned and enjoy a soft budget constraint themselves. Their profits are protected by the spread between the benchmark bank deposit rates and lending rates, which are set by the People’s Bank of China. This spread has remained around 3% in the past 20 years. When this spread was insufficient to cover the bad loans of these banks in the 1990s and early 2000s, the government twice recapitalized them and eventually listed all of them in the stock markets both inside China on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and outside on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>A direct implication of the soft budget constraint is that SOEs, state banks, and local governments are not as price sensitive as one would expect from profit-maximizing agents. For example, after the crisis-induced economic stimulus program ended in 2010, despite that the central government explicitly instructed local governments to scale down many of their projects and banks to stop funding those projects, local governments continued to scale up rather than down, and managed to obtain funding from the shadow banking system at substantially higher costs (Chen, He, and Liu, 2017). When a substantial fraction of the participants are not particularly sensitive to the costs of funding, it is difficult for asset prices determined by the typical market equilibrium to be efficiently anchored on the asset fundamentals. Thus, the lack of price sensitivity of these important institutions has been a key obstacle for China to develop a market-driven financial system. This is also a key reason for the PBC’s current use of a quantity based monetary policy framework that directly targets money supply (Sun, 2015), rather than a seemingly more convenient price-based framework that anchors on interest rates like the one used by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.</p>
<p>Another implication of the soft budget constraint is implicit government guarantees. Specifically, even when SOEs, state banks, and local governments suffer large financial losses, their creditors anticipate the government to bail them out. As a result, creditors continue to offer them credit at substantially lower costs relative to private firms with similar financial status. This in turn encourages them to further build up, rather than scale down, financial leverage. This kind of riskseeking problem is a standard agency problem, caused by the implicit government guarantee, and is a key for understanding risks in China’s financial system. Zhu (2016) provides an extensive account of how government guarantees might have contributed to excessive speculation and price bubbles in China.</p>
<p>China saves about half of its GDP (the solid line in Figure 3). The high aggregate saving rate comes from high savings by both households and firms. China’s urban household survey, which biases saving rates downward by underrepresenting rich households, shows an average saving rate of 30%. The national data adjusted by NBS suggests the household sector saves more than 40% of its earnings. There is a long list of factors that may contribute to the extraordinarily high household saving rate. All the factors are associated with some China-specific institutional features, suggesting that high household savings are likely to persist in the near future.</p>
<p>The housing price boom greatly increased the net worth of Chinese households. Despite the fastgrowing mortgage, balance sheet of Chinese households remains solid. Only 30% of bank loans are made to households (mostly mortgage loans). While the required down payment varies over time, it has stayed at high levels—at least 20% for first homes and 30% for second homes. To curb the recent housing price boom, the required down payment was raised at some point to 50% or higher in some big cities. Even a significant housing price adjustment would be unlikely to trigger a mortgage crisis of the scale seen in the Great Recession of the U.S.</p>
<p>Chinese firms also save a lot. The corporate sector accounts for about half of the nongovernment savings (Yang, Zhang, and Zhou, 2011). The literature is relatively thin on China’s high corporate saving rate. Yet, it has been widely acknowledged that this is caused by firms’ precautionary motives (see, e.g., Li, 2001; Gordon and Li, 2003). Due to the nature of the dualtrack reform discussed above, the financial system—including banks, the stock market, and the bond market—favors SOEs. As a result, most private businesses were excluded from the formal credit channels and private investment was primarily financed by firms’ own savings (Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005). In turn, higher returns to investment in the private sector—the flip side of the higher financing costs—encourage private firms to save more. Again, this is unlikely to change in the near future.</p>
<p>Despite the financial frictions and other barriers, the private sector has been flourishing over the past two decades. It now accounts for 80% of China’s urban employment and continues to be the main growth engine. The inefficient state sector used to be a big burden that could possibly drag China into a crisis. While the reform of the state sector is far from complete, the surviving SOEs have greatly improved their vitality. In contrast to their moribund status in the 1990s, today’s<br>SOEs do not pose an imminent threat to China’s economic and financial stability. In fact, some of the SOEs have even managed to establish monopolistic positions in various upstream industries, such as energy, transportation, telecommunications, and finance, under the protection of industry regulations (see e.g., Li, Liu, and Wang, 2014). The main concern is now more on the relatively low efficiency of the state sector and its long-run implications. </p>
<p>In summary, China’s domestic savings are more than enough to finance its investment, a blessing for a fast-growing economy. Figure 3 shows that the aggregate saving rate has been above the investment rate since the mid 1990s—a mirror image of China’s trade surplus (Song, Storesletten, and Zilibotti, 2017). The investment boom in the post-2008 period has reduced but has not yet completely removed the surplus. There is no significant external debt. A Greece-like crisis is unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>The Budget Law enacted in 1994 prohibited local governments from running budgetary deficits. External financing was not allowed either.12 This has been widely viewed as a critical step in confining the soft budget constraint problem between local governments and their favored businesses. Instead, since the late 1990s, local governments greatly expanded their fiscal capacity by relying on non-budgetary funding sources such as land revenue. The Chinese constitution states that urban land is owned by the State. In practice, land is administered by local governments. Revenue from sales of land use rights (land revenue henceforth) has accounted for about one-third of local government revenue (the sum of local fiscal revenue and land revenue) since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Tying local government budget to land revenue is a novel mechanism design. Given the initial condition of underdevelopment across Chinese cities, local tax revenue was far from covering the need for funding large capital intensive infrastructure projects and other local business developments. The great uncertainty also discouraged banks from funding such projects, even if local governments were allowed to directly raise debt financing. On the other hand, like equity prices, the land prices that buyers pay are determined not only by the current business conditions in a city but also their expected future conditions. Conditional on local governments using land revenue to improve local infrastructure and business environments, land prices can be substantially higher than what is justified by current business conditions, just like the oftenobserved high share prices of new technology firms even when they have no earnings yet. The need for local governments to regularly sell land to the public also serves as a device to discipline them to carry out their pledged infrastructure projects. This arrangement is similar to<br>staged venture capital financing for new firms.</p>
<p>This budgetary arrangement gives local governments the necessary resources and incentives to invest in infrastructure projects and support local businesses, which had greatly contributed to the rapid urban and business developments across Chinese cities. The net effect of this budgetary reform on the soft budget constraint is ambiguous, as local governments also have more resources to bail out failed businesses.</p>
<p>The 2008 stimulus plan compromised the borrowing constraint on local governments. Bai, Hsieh and Song (2016) demonstrate that most of the stimulus was financed by local governments through bank loans, as local governments could not have sold so much land to cover the stimulus. To facilitate local financing, the central government, for the first time since the early 1980s, relaxed the financial controls on local governments. A prominent regulatory change made by CBRC turned out to be a key step (Document No. 92, CBRC, March 18, 2009). Specifically, local governments were encouraged to set up local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) to borrow from banks and financial institutions. This circumvents the Budget Law that prohibits local government from borrowing. Auxiliary regulatory changes were also made by various units in the central government (including the Ministry of Finance) to endorse LGFVs. Consequently, about 1,800 LGFVs issued bonds by 2015, while less than 100 did so before 2008. Local government debt is accumulating disturbingly fast even by the official statistics: The outstanding local government debt increased from less than 5 trillion yuan in 2008 to 23 trillion yuan in 2015. Bai, Hsieh, and Song (2016) argue that a lot of debt borrowed by LGFVs is not officially classified as local government debt. Their estimates suggest that the outstanding debt of LGFVs could be 46 trillion yuan in 2015, which is twice as much as the official size of local government debt and about two-thirds of GDP in that year. Xiong (in progress) attributes the rapid growth of LGFV debt to the tournament competition between local government officials.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be far-fetched to conclude that local governments are becoming illiquid or insolvent. With annual fiscal revenues of 8 trillion yuan and annual land revenues of 3 trillion yuan, local governments have sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on their debt. Moreover, LGFVs’ assets actually outgrew their liability. For the 1,800 LGFVs studied by Bai et al (2016), their total assets amount to 70 trillion yuan— 50% more than their liability. Much of the assets<br>are land reserves. In other words, local governments are unlikely to be illiquid or insolvent in the near future unless China experiences a dramatic land price adjustment.</p>
<p>China has a bank-based financial system. Bond and equity financing only account for about onefifth of the total credit to non-financial institutions. Unlike the non-financial sector, the financial sector is predominated by state-owned financial institutions. Most banks are state-owned. The Big Four alone contribute to more than 40% of total bank deposits. The main business of China’s commercial banks is taking deposits and making loans. Before 2015, bank profits were guaranteed by interest-rate regulation that imposed a floor for the loan rate and a ceiling for the deposit rate, both around the benchmark loan rate and deposit rate published by the PBC. These benchmark rates usually leave a spread around 3 percentage points, which is the main source of bank revenue. In 2015, the floor and cap were removed as a key to liberalizing interest rates. Nevertheless, the PBC continues to publish benchmark deposit and loan rates, and banks continue to closely follow them and profit from the spread.</p>
<p>The competition for deposits among banks led to the rise of wealth management products (WMP henceforth), which are saving instruments that are not constrained by the deposit rate ceiling. In the mid-2000s, banks started to issue WMPs with higher returns. The tightening of the loan-to-deposit cap in the late 2000s further gave rise to non-guaranteed WMPs, which can move loans and deposits off balance sheets. This led to rich shadow banking activities (Hachem and Song, 2016). Figure 4 plots WMP as percentage of GDP, which increases from 2% in 2007 to 34% in 2015.</p>
<p>Despite the recent rapid development of shadow banking, its overall size remains modest, with the total WMP balance being merely 18% of total bank deposits by the end of 2015,18 partly because the central government has tightened regulations by incorporating shadow banking activities into the PBC’s macroprudential policy framework and thus imposing required capital on banks for such activities. The interbank market has become an increasingly important source for small and median-sized banks’ liquidity. Yet, the Big Four remain a key fund supplier and can easily influence the market (Hachem and Song, 2016). The rise of shadow banking has nevertheless presented a great challenge to China’s monetary policy, which adopts a quantity based framework with an intermediate policy target on money growth. Concerned by the difficulty in fully accounting for banks’ on- and off-balance sheet activities, the PBC has been pushing strongly for interest-rate liberalization, which is the necessary foundation for it to ultimately adopt a price-based monetary policy framework as an automatic stabilizer. To expose<br>banks to more market competition, the PBC has been actively promoting the bond market, which has experienced rapid growth in recent years. The bond market now trades bonds issued by the central and local governments, as well as SOEs and publicly listed firms. The outstanding quantity of bonds has recently reached over 30% of bank loans. Equity financing accounts for a much smaller fraction of the total credit. As will be discussed in the following section, there have been very few defaults and delistings in China’s bond and stock markets—a natural consequence of the above features associated with the dual-track reform. Interest-rate liberalization in such a system may cause more capital to flow to the state sector or the shadow banking and, hence, aggravate welfare losses, e.g., Liu, Wang and Xu (2017) and Wang et al. (2017). </p>
<p>As discussed earlier, the issue of quickly rising financial leverage across China has arisen in recent years. In particular, a substantial fraction of the sharply increased debt was channeled through shadow banking. The joint occurrence of rapid housing price appreciation and quickly rising debt levels has alerted many commentators to the possibility of a debt crisis in China, e.g., Chen (2015) and Maliszewski et al. (2016). In particular, many are worried that China might follow in the footsteps of the U.S., which experienced a severe financial crisis initially triggered by the reversal of a dramatic housing boom in the mid-2000s. The U.S. housing boom was largely financed by a dramatic credit expansion across the country to households and financial firms, and in particular, credit expansion through the shadow banking system to subprime households (see e.g., Mian and Sufi, 2009).</p>
<p>Several factors make it unlikely for a Western-style debt crisis to occur in China in the short run. First, China has a large pool of domestic savings and a low level of external debt (see Section III). Most of the debt in China is issued not only domestically but also even more conveniently from state-owned banks to state-owned firms. In fact, such asymmetry has been further strengthened in the post-2008 period for reasons discussed above. Second, and perhaps more importantly, Chinese institutions have been flexible enough for the State to develop creative ways to defuse crisis in the short run.</p>
<p>Some important policies implemented in the cleanup of massive bad loans in 1990s and 2000s are particularly worth documenting, as they may shed light on the possible tactics to be adopted in the future (see Walter and Howie (2012) for an excellent review). The moribund state sector led banks to have a non-performing loan ratio above 30% in the late 1990s, a dangerous level that is likely to trigger a full-blown bank-run crisis in any economy with rigid market and policy rules (see below for more detailed discussions). To absorb the bad loans, the Chinese State took three steps to bend the rules without breaking them entirely. Firstly, the central bank lowered the required reserve ratio to allow banks to buy special government bonds, which, in turn, were invested in banks as capital. Secondly, four large asset management companies were established in 1999, one for each of the Big Four, to absorb their non-performing loans. This is also referred to as the good bank/bad bank strategy. In the Chinese context, the bad banks (i.e., the asset management companies) were thinly capitalized, while holding huge assets backed by nonperforming loans that were not appropriately valued. Thirdly, to publicly list the Big Four, the State injected about USD 50 billion in 2003 from its foreign reserve into two of the Big Four. These tactics did not resolve bad loans. Rather, they managed to move the problems to the future. Fortunately, the strong economic growth and rapid expansion of the financial sector afterwards eventually absorb the bad loans. In short, it is the State, rather than market rules, that<br>has the final say on bankruptcy. So long as the State has resources and willingness to save big businesses, bankruptcies with substantial aggregate implications would not occur.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the rising leverage per se would not lead China to a Western-style debt crisis. However, the flexibility and capacity of the Chinese State to defuse the potential debt crisis also reflect its lack of commitments to liquidate inefficient firms, which is the key driver of the rising leverage in the first place, and which would eventually lead to other severe long-run problems. Xiong (in progress) develops a theoretical model to show that the ability of local governments to coordinate banks in rolling over their debt to LGFVs disables banks from exerting the much needed market discipline on the excessive leverage of local governments.</p>
<p>Overall, the enormous housing price appreciation across China is supported by rapid household income growth, yet the high price-to-income ratios across different cities build on high expectations of future economic growth and income growth. Thus, like the debt crisis risk, the housing risk is also essentially the economic growth risk. If the economic growth rate falls substantially below the currently level of 6.9% in the near future, it would be difficult to sustain the home buyers’ high expectations and thus to keep the price-to-income ratios at the current level.</p>
<p>Due to the two-track structure of the Chinese economy, the government has maintained a highly active role in managing the economy and the financial system. The extensive policy interventions by the government have important implications for the risk and efficiency of the financial system. </p>
<p>There are several key reasons that motivate government interventions in the financial system. First, as we discussed before, the financial system provides the necessary financial instruments to fund the government’s policy agenda. As a result, the government has taken various initiatives to develop different financial markets/sectors to meet its funding needs. Second, the government believes that countercyclical management of the financial system is necessary due to the presence of a large pool of inexperienced institutions and investors, which are often subject to excessive sentimental fluctuations. Guided by a paternalistic philosophy to protect inexperienced investors and maintain market stability, the government has employed a wide range of policy tools to intervene in the financial system. </p>
<p>Active government interventions have profound impacts on the financial system. Policies and regulations can deliver unintended consequences, some of which may be entirely counterproductive. While countercyclical interventions help to stabilize financial markets, they may reduce the information efficiency of asset prices. An unintended consequence of government interventions is that interventions add another source of noise from the government’s policymaking processes into the financial markets. When the interventions are sufficiently active, this government noise factor would become a key factor in driving market dynamics. When this happens, investors and market participants may devote their limited attention to analyzing the government factor rather than economic fundamentals, which in turn may make asset prices in the financial system less efficient in reflecting economic fundamentals. Brunnermeier, Sockin, and Xiong (2017b) recently developed a theoretical model to highlight this economic mechanism. </p>
<p>Brunnermeier, Sockin, and Xiong (2017a) further argue that this unintended consequence of government interventions may undermine the government’s financial reform. “Crossing the river by touching the stones” has been a hallmark strategy of China’s economic reform. This strategy has worked well because it usually takes months, even quarters, for the economy to react to a policy change, leaving policy makers just enough time to study the reaction and discern appropriate policy adjustments. However, predictable policy changes in financial markets would stimulate speculation by market participants. Speculation, especially frenzied speculation with high leverage, may destabilize the markets. When this happens, speculation may cause asset prices to overshoot to levels beyond what are justified by the government’s intended policy change and may even force the government to make the policy change more aggressive than initially planned. At a deeper level, this leads to the widely discussed time-inconsistency problem in policy making. </p>
<p>Through the aforementioned channels, households and firms across the country have strong incentives to use various instruments offered by the financial system to load on risks that are tied to policy agendas and regulations of the government. As a result, the financial system may serve to aggregate risks—risks that are backed by the government, instead of spreading risks across different households and firms. This may eventually reduce the efficiency of the financial system and exacerbate the systemic risk. </p>
<p>By reviewing China’s unique economic and financial systems, we argue that the widely held concerns about the rising leverage and housing prices are unlikely to lead to an imminent financial crisis in China. Instead, we believe the ultimate risk lies with the efficiency of the financial system in allocating capital and supporting China’s economic growth. In particular, a vicious cycle of distortions in the financial system may lower economic growth and exacerbate<br>financial risks in the long run.</p>
