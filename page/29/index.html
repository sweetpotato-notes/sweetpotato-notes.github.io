        <p>The classical economists who laid the foundations of our subject had a characteristic strategy for handling the uncertain future. They built their science by treating the present as determined by the past. The important thing about the past is that it has already happened. The past is a fact and nothing we do today can change it. It is also a knowable fact, at least in principle, so we can hpe in our economic theories to draw a deterministic link between known causes and observable effects. In pursuit of this hope, the classical economists sought to discover the laws of motion of the economic system.</p>
<p>The one free variable in the classical system is human action, including collective human action. In Adam Smith’s view, much of individual behavior is driven by innate human propensities, but reason offers each individual the opportunity to direct those propensities, and so to live a better life. The same reason also offers societies the opportunity to make their own history, not perhaps just as they might please, but also not as completely determined by the dead hand of the past. Economic theory, as a product of reason, has its purpose to provide direction for the application of reason, both individual and collective.</p>
<p>But the times they were achanging. What is rational to do today depends in part on what we expect to happen tomorrow, but attempts to expand the scope of economic reason to incorporate the future ran head on into what John Maynard Keynes famously called the ‘dark forces of time and ignorance which envelop our future’ (Keynes 1936, p.155). In the twentieth century view, uncertainty about the future was no longer something that science could hope eventually to penetrate. The salient fact about the world was no longer the continuity of the past and future, but rather the radical disjuncture between the two on account of the speed of change, not least the speed of technological change. The one thing the rational mind could know about the future is that it would in important ways be different from anything now imaginable, perhaps better but also perhaps worse.</p>
<p>The post World War II development of the theory of monetary and fiscal policy can be viewed as the elaboration of two specific mechanisms of social control for this purpose. The famous Keynesian cross, that explained how the flow of current demand determines the flow of current output, set the pattern for how to do science in the face of an unknowable future. It was a theory that avoided the unknowable future by treating the present as determined by the present. ‘Animal spirits’ that affect current expenditure are the free variables that, for individual agents, take the place of impossible rational analysis of the future. And fiscal and monetary policy are the free variable that, for the collectivity, select one future path among the many that are possible.</p>
<p>Finance was first to crystallize a general equilibrium model of the twentieth century view that the future determines the present, but the wider significance of the new view was only felt as it found its way into economics. In macroeconomics, the most important consequences were the Rational Expectations revolution and then Real Business Cycles. Just so, in modern DSGE models, present conditions are largely understood as the effect of an anticipated future. The physical capital stock of course is inherited from the past but the economic importance of that stock, as measured by its current valuation, all comes from the future.</p>
<p>Post Walrasians take a different tack, emphasizing that the future is not a knowable fact, not even in principle, and not even in probabilistic terms. Theories of asset pricing that posit known probabilities abstract from this feature of the world, and so do the various versions of the DSGE model of the macroeconomy. As such, they offer nothing more than one possible story about one possible future. The important thing is that, to the extent that people believe this story, or any other story, they adjust their current behavior accordingly. In this sense, one of the most important lessons of the DSGE model is that economic theories themselves are the significant knowable facts in the modern world. Post Walrasians ask what happens in a world where a large number of people interact, each one behaving according to their own theory about the future.</p>
<p>Post Walrasian work represents an attempt to broaden out from the DSGE model in order to deal with the deeper uncertainty, rational choice no longer provides much analytical traction, so Post Walrasian work treats agents as dealing with information poor environments, and having limited information processing capabilities. Neverthless, the general idea that behavior should be model-consistent remains attractive. Model consistency replaces rational expectations as the closure of Post Wlarasian models.</p>
<p>The important thing is that Post Walrasian work seeks to model the process by which one among many possible futures is selected, rather than imposing constraints on the model that ensure only a single equilibrium outcome. In this regard, Post Walrasian work builds on the classical Marshallian concept of adaptive dynamics, but freed of the mathematical assumptions necessary to guarantee stability and convergence to a single equilibrium. The Swedish contemporaries of Keynes arguably had something like the Post Walrasian program in mind in their various attempts to model economic process, but the analytical difficulty of the problem defeated them. As a consequence, what we got instead was Keynes, and then Fisher. Post Walrasian work has, in this sense, been waiting in the wings for a century until the present moment when analytical technology has caught up to our analytical needs.</p>
<p>The agent-based literature is full of examples that demonstrate how the aggregate bahavior of the system changes when we add a new kind of agent. Here we can see a clear opening for development of a theory of economic policy. For example, the central bank could be considered as a new kind of agent, operating perhaps with the very same information set as the most sophisticated agents in the model, but with different instruments and a different objective fucntion. It seems unlikely that a world that includes such an agent will exhibit the same aggregate behavior as a world without such an agent. In other words, policy invariance is unlikely to be a robust feature of agent-based models, even when individual behaviors are all constrained to be model-consistent.</p>
<p>The Post Walrasian view builds on the tradition of Fisher and Keynes, both of whom recognized the problem of time as the significant challenge for further development of economics. In contrast to their classical forebears, Fisher and Keynes both recognized the degree of freedom offered by the open-ended future; when behavior depends on expectations about the future, volatility is the consequence. But both also held out hope that human reason, and the institutions that human reason would invent, could find ways to manage that volatility.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Fisher and Keynes, modern economics has developed both modern finance and th DSGE model that now lies at the core of modern macroeconomics. These developments have gone a long distance toward grappling with the problem of time, but more work remains to be done. The Post Walrasian view envision a world of even greater uncertainty than that embraced by modern finance and the DSGE model, and a world that is for that very reason amenable to a wider range of refinements and improvements that have yet to be considered. The volatility of capital values and incomes is just a fact, an inevitable consequence of shifting ideas about the future in a period of rapid technological change. The policy challenge remains to shift that volatility onto the shoulders of those most able and willing to bear it.</p>
