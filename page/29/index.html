        <p>Beginning in the mid-19th century, various inadquacies that appeared in the early stage of capitalism led to the emergence of communist thoughts and ideology, with the argument that communism could provide a better form of societal organization. In much of the 20th century, however, socialism and communism were ‘practiced’ through either revolutionary movements, in the case of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, or by the election of prosocialist governments that adopted prosocialist economic policies in the name of ‘equality’ and ‘redistribution’ through high tax rates and large government spending, but ended up with a loss of economic competitiveness and accumulation of huge national debts that effectively limited the development of future generations. </p>
<p>After the exercise of different degrees of socialist and leftist practices and policies over the entire 20th century, it is time to make an assessment to see if there has been an excessive application of socialism. Indeed, the table could have been turned, and the situation in the 19th century when advocates were looking for an alternative to capitalism would be the inverse of the situation in the 21st century when extensive application of socialist policies had done harm and should be reversed, and capitalist economic policies would be needed to rejuvenate the world economy to a new phase of development. The various socialist policies have impeded parts of the world economy from growing, and at the same time slow growth has been faced challenges from terrorist activities, instabilities in different world regions, and the ideological challenge from socialist countries.</p>
<p>In the Western world, the decades-long ultralow interest rate in the United States and much of the developed world has boosted the world financial market, but it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between investment and speculation. In theory, a low cost of borrowing would mean erosion in the store of value function of money. Equally, the prolonged period of low interest rates is meant to stimulate productive investment, but unfortunately, it could have stimulated speculation and contributed to the 2008 finanical crisis and subsequent world economic recession.</p>
<p>In many ways, there is no single answer to all these challenging world problems. What is more important is to see how many of the superficial events can be explained by more in-depth intuition, conceptual understanding, and theoretical frameworks. It is against such global events that a ‘redefinition’ of capitalism is needed to reinterpret the capitalism ideology in the modern context, highlighting the virtues of classical economics and how it can be used to solve contemporary global problems. One can argue that recent world events are not due to the growing irrelevance of capitalism, but rather are due to a lack of renewed understanding and the need to reorientate the various elements and texture of capitalism in light of the global events. Indeed, many economic activities in much of the modern world have deviated from the origins of capitalist economic principles.</p>
<p>Societies are composed of individuals, as economic decisions are mostly conducted by individuals….It was Adam Smith’s (1776) metaphor of the ‘invisible hand’ that had piercingly symbolized the advantages of individuals’ achievements, the capitalist mode of production, and the minimum role of the government in conducting economic activities (Butler, 2007). When all individuals utilize their own endowments to achieve their utmost, society is said to have reached its maximum level of growth, development, and output capacity (Sowell, 1974).</p>
<p>However, individuals perform differently, with some being more successful than others, with some having more individual endowments than others, and with some exposed to more economic opportunities than others. In economics, the capability of an individual is indicated by that individual’s productivity. It is true that through education and training, society produces individuals who would take up different professions and jobs that yield different productivity, and are therefore rewarded differently. Unfortunately, not all individuals show the same level of productivity. In the productivity hierarchy, there are always more ‘low-productivity’ or ‘low-endowment’ individuals than ‘high-productivity’ or ‘high-endowment’ individuals. At the extreme, ‘low-productivity’ individuals could face a survival problem if their pecuniary earnings are not sufficient to pay for their survival cost. Hence, the discussion on capitalism would extend to the role of government, and the need for redistribution, while the contrary argument would be the extent of disincentive on the part of ‘high-productivity’ individuals (Wade, 1990; Tanzi and Schuknecht, 1997).</p>
<p>The ultimate advantage of capitalism is its ability to regenerate and rejuvenate economic activities despite the emergence of business cycles that result in economic volatility, as it is the individuals who know best their marketability given the different and changing economic conditions. In economic cycles, some businesses make profits while others experience losses, but market dynamism would always permit new businesses to emerge and prosper. Capitalism allows automatic market replenishment through the voluntary activities of individuals.</p>
<p>The economics of externality, commonly known as ‘market failure,’ argue that while people are maximizing their economic welfare, it is possible that their activities infringe on other people and resources, either positively or negatively (Buchanan and Stubblebine, 1962; Trenery Dolbear, 1967; Dahlman, 1979). However, there can be complications, such as the availability of required information and the number of individuals involved. The cost of bringing the case to justice through legal action can be high and time consuming. A clear definition of property rights is crucial in the analysis of externality (Demsetz, 1967). When both private cost and private benefit arising from the externality are quantifiable, mutual or legal settlements can eventually be formulated. Illegal activities are cases of negative externalities, when individuals or firms infringe on the legal rights of other persons and firms. Complications arise when social cost and social benefit are involved, or they differ from private cost and private benefit. In the first place, social cost and social benefit may not be quantifiable. Second, the ownership right may not be clearly defined. Executing and monitoring the resulting damage from externality cases can be problematic, and it is common for the government to get involved.</p>
<p>The situation is less controversial in the case of positive externality, especially if the benefits last for generations. The construction of new infrasturcture can bring long-term economic benefits to the community. In most cases, the problem arises in negative esternalit, especially when the private benefit so derived occurred at the expense of social cost. In short, some private individuals gained from the externality, but society has to bear the cost. This often relates to social or common goods that private individuals can have access to, and it becomes difficult to monitor the action of private individuals. The ultimate question is the lack of property rights in a number of common goods, such as forests, natural resources, rare animal species, clean and fresh air, as well as a number of ‘common bad,’ such as carbon emission, natural disasters, garbage disposal, drug abuse, and so on. In all these cases, the lack of property right implies that individuals and firms are interested in obtaining the private benefits, but are not interested in bearing the social cost.</p>
<p>It was perhaps inappropriate to use the term ‘market failure’ to explain externality. A free market and capitalism do not operate in a vacuum, but require strong institutions, well-established legal frameworks, and a mature civic environment so that the market concept can gradually be extended to new areas. Externality can be considered as an example in which the institution of markets will dynamically be extended to uncharted areas. A free market is not a one-time affair, but develops dynamically and continuously along with other aspects of development. The ‘invisible hand’ in the allocation of resources is a dynamic concept where resource availability and utilization change as new development occurs. This is the true spirit of the ‘invisible hand,’ and the function of the free market mechanism.</p>
<p>Microeconomic theories tell us that classical economics begins with the virtue of perfect competition with four assumptions of a homogenous product, perfect market information, freedom of exit and entry of firms, and the presence of a large number of firms. In perfect competition, firms cannot influence each other and are price takers, as consumers are aware of the supply and demand conditions through the avaiable market information. By varying the assumptions of perfect competition, a few theoretical versions of imperfect competition have been developed, including monopoly, duopoly, and oligopoly that involve, respectively, only one, two, and few firms in the market, and monopolistic competition and contestable markets that lie between perfect competition and monopoly (Robinson, 1933; Baumol, 1982).</p>
<p>Monopoly appears when the market is supplied by only one firm. In product markets, this is possible but unlikely, as laws can be instituted against the single supplier, and there are always distant substitutes in the market for consumers. The more likely case of a single supplier appears in infrastructure or ‘common goods’ that require either a large capital investment, or where the market can only allow one supplier to survive. This is referred to as ‘natural monopoly.’ Typically, public utilities, such as bridges, trains, fire service, police, and military involving either huge investments or national security would usually be supplied by a single supplier. In a geographically large country, it may be true that even infrastructure can be made competitive in different states or regions. Other experiences of ‘natural monopoly’ cases are that the government or the state will be responsible for the building of key infrasturcture, either wholly or jointly with the private sector, in order to minimize the price charged by the monopolistic supplier. In public utilites, such as schools and hospitals, there can be dual supply in the market, and both the public sector and the private investors can compete to provide educational and health services. The dual supply model allows service users a choice between public or private schools and hospitals, and can serve as a check and balance between different suppliers in terms of price, quality, and service to ensure high professional and ethical standards. On the contrary, countries thinking that social equality would be achieved by state-owned institutions, e.g., in hospital and health services, can end up with low quality supply and excess demand due to the imposition of a ceiling price.</p>
<p>The various dimensions of competition among firms tend to show that competition is a process, and that competition can take different forms at different times, and competition can differ between products and markets. Given that the market is open for new entrants, firms cannot stop competition. As such, what could stop competition is really the market itself, namely whether new entrants see the potential in market, either due to the large capital needed and the risk involved, the market is saturated and profit may not be forthcoming, the business environment is not favorable for new firms to enter because of economic recession and low demand, there is lack of creativity on the part of the investors in exploring the market potential, or that the policy is not market-friendly. In short, market competition goes beyond simply supply and demand, but includes the market and policy environment and conditions in which firms operate.</p>
<p>The Marxists imposed a poticial criterion on economic outcomes. In a planned Marxian economy, individuals are controlled by the state and economic outcomes are ‘equal’ when they are given similar materials allocations from the state. But in actuality, the extent of inequality has shifted from one of economic inequality to political inequality, in that power is concentrated in the hands of state officials. To ensure ‘equality’ in economic outcomes, the state in communism controlled all factor inputs. It turned out that the ‘life-long’ nature of political inequality could be more detrimental than income inequality, and the chances for making individual progress would disappear for those not affiliated to the political party in a communist state.</p>
<p>Economic freedom is another crucial ingredient in capitalism. Numerous studies have concluded that economic freedom promotes growth, development, and prosperity, because individuals are given the freedom to do their best unhindered. Individual satisfaction in their job performance would also mean a new frontier in their own profession and talent, thereby generating more economic activities that would accumulate, spread, or trickle down to other economic aspects. Ultimately, it is the contribution by individual activities at the microeconomic level that push the macro-economy to grow, expand, and prosper.</p>
<p>Capitalism encourages and allows individuals to do their best, so that they can take care of their private cost, leaving a minimum of endowment-low individuals that cannot meet their economic survival and whose needs will have to be passed on to the society. Hence, the more economically able individuals there are, the less the need to pass on their private cost to society, and the less the need for social welfare, the lower the social cost would become. The incentive for individuals to take care of their private cost and the minimization of social cost is another ingredient of capitalism, because this can allow economies to grow to their fullest extent, and at the same time provide a minimum economic net or security for endowment-low individuals. More importantly, individuals can improve their personal endowment to make economic progress over time.</p>
<p>In contemporary economics, Say’s Law is discussed within the context of ‘supply-side’ economics (Cantoet al., 1983; Feldstein, 1986; Helliwell, 1986; Marshall and Arestis, 1989; Lucas, 1990). By using simple supply and demand curves, David Harper has given a simple explanation of ‘supply-side’ economics in the website of Investopedia. The simple argument is that situations of ‘over’ or ‘under’ production cannot last long as variation in inventory and prices will eventually remove any excesses or shortages. Supply-side economics argues that demand is irrelevant, as consumers will respond to the price set by the suppliers. The three pillars that formed the backbone of supply-side economics include: (1) a low marginal tax rate that does not impose unnecessary disincentives to businesses and workers; (2) a small government with least intervention that allows maximum economic freedom; and (3) a prudent monetary policy that would not create excessive liquidity and inflation.</p>
<p>Supply-side economics is preferred, because supply is first in a chain of economic activities. Once supplied, the goods and services would then be demanded in the market. Market forces will eliminate unsuccessful and uncompetitive supply when there is insufficient demand. In the process of supply, jobs are generated due to the need for production inputs, and employment gives rise to wage payments. Workers would then use the wage for consumption, thereby giving rise to demand. On the contrary, ‘demand-side’ economics is important only when individuals have sufficient earnings to consume. The ability to consume depends on the ability to earn, the possibility to earn depends on employment opportunities and job security, employment depends on productive activities, and production ultimately relates to the ability to supply.</p>
<p>Demand-side economics can best be regarded as a short-run strategy. Immediately after a major crisis, the ‘ultra-low’ economic expectation would need stimulus in order to avoid further hardship. The government can then exercise its fiscal ability by making short-term spending. Once the imminence of the economic crisis was over, demand-led economic strategy should give way to supply-led economic strategies. It is true that supply-led strategies tend to take time to materialize, as business decisions and productive activities would take time to execute, but ultimately it is the rise in physical output that can see more goods available in the market. The increase in goods’ supply would help to lower inflation and promote purchasing power. In short, supply-side economices produces a ‘virtuous circle’ of economic activities.</p>
<p>Cutting tax is a popular instrument used in supply-side economics. A lower tax would stimulate businesses, the increase in subsequent investment would be productive, and the increase in output and employment would eventually promote growth and lift the economy from recession and crisis. However, the positive impact of cutting tax could depnd on a number of factors. With a lower tax, investment would take time to materialize, and supply would take time to produce. The delay could differ among business and industries. Second, it also depends on what kind of investment a lower tax would stimulate, as some investments may not be output oriented, or even speculative in nature. Third, the sustainability of the tax cut can be another factor. Investment, which often involves long-term activity, may not consider a tax cut favorable if the expectation was that the cuts were meant to be short-lived and would be revived in due course. In short, the short-term impact of a tax cut might not be obvious, as it is the consistency of a low tax regime, not the fluctuation of tax rate, that counts. A low tax rate should be seen more as a fiscal infrastructure that constantly promotes investment than as an instrument that influences business cycles.</p>
<p>Where can one find perfect equlity in this world? Inequality is as old as humanity, and perfect equality can never be achieved. It is the human race that exerts one kind of inequality or another on each other. History has shown that there are numerous kinds of inequality: sex, race, religion, geographical and regional, language, ethnic and tribal, aristocracy and social class, political and ideological. It would be worse if more than one aspect of inequality appeared at the same time. A typical example would be a combination of sex, religious, ethnic, and class inequalities. A major problem with these types of human inequality is that they can be permanent and last for a life time, and there is no chance that such inequality and discrimination could be eradicated. Many inequalities are ‘human-made’ and can still be found in different parts of the contemporary world.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, one can argue that income inequality probably will be the ‘best’ form of inequality, because income inequality need not be permanent and can be improved in one’s life time, provided that a progressive economic environment is generated. The methods of income inequality measurement can also vary and produce different implications. There is a dilemma in understanding inequality in many contemporary economies. Individuals will receive different training based on their talents, innate ability, academic performance, and family background. Hence, different types of professionals are trained, nurtured, and produced, and the earnings are different among professionals, jobs, and employment opportunities. The dilemma is that the economy spends resources to train highly skilled professionals, but at the same time complains about the inequality in wage earnings among different jobs.</p>
<p>One way to understand such a dilemma is that the term ‘income inequality’ comes from two separate disciplines. Income is an economic term and it reflects the productivity level of individual workers. Someone with a highly skilled job would have higher productivity and a higher degree of marketability, and therefore the skilled individual should earn a handsome reward. On the contrary, a low-skilled worker would have lower productivity and marketability, and could only earn a lower reward. The difference represents the market outcome of individuals with different skills. On the contrary, the term ‘inequality’ is more of a political and social term. In a civilized and humane world, people simply prefer to see a greater degree of equality. The dilemma arises as a result of binding together an economic outcome and a political or moral desire. As such, it would be desirable to seek ‘income equality,’ even though the law of economics is that outcomes are often ‘unequal.’</p>
<p>In short, the inequality issue has long been debated, and yet the extent of income inequality in the global economy has not been much improved. Perhaps the alternative is to examine and understand the concept of inequlity itself, and separate the intellectual discussion between the economics arena and social arena. In economics, income inequality arises from the fact that individuals’ endowmens are rewarded differently. Poverty is the more popular term used to describe ‘endowment-low’ individuals. The society should not penalize ‘endowment-high’ individuals as the are productive, but shoul look for means to aid the poor to avoid unnecessary economic hardship. Hence, the discussion would be extended to examine the issues in poverty.</p>
<p>It follows that improvements in income inequality might not be permanent, and the Gini Coefficient of any economy would move up and down depending on economic cycles. To reverse the trend of deterioration in income inequality, economic policies should be employment-enhancing. Indeed, one can argue that it would take a longer time to improve income inequality than for income inequality to deteriorate. A major and sudden crisis that resulted in recession would immediately result in deterioriation in income inequality. But for income inequality to improve, the rise in income and employment would require other complementary activities, such as productive investments that are job-enhancing.</p>
<p>When compared to the stock approach that considers the mainly ‘demand-driven’ policy of welfare provisions, the flow approach will need to institute ‘supply-driven’ policies that enlarge the physical capability of the economy. It is true that ‘supply-driven’ policies are more sustainable than ‘demand-driven’ policies in solving the poverty problem, because ‘supply-driven’ policies ensure that they have their own ability to stay in the job market. The difference, as the metaphor suggests, is whether you are ‘giving a fish to the person’ or ‘teaching the perso hwo to fish.’</p>
<p>However, one can recognize that the poverty issue in many underdeveloped countries concerned absolute poverty, whereby the conditions for economic progress are missing or not instituted. Typically, modern economic progress cannot be made if the society’s development is still in its primitive and tribal stage. Weak governance in many fragile states imposed much hardship and uncertainty on their own citizens, resulting in large flow of illegal immigrants to neighboring countries. In these extreme cases, it would be inappropriate to exercise the concept of ‘poverty’ into these underdeveloped societies where economic gains and welfare cannot constitute nor improve their daily living standards. As such, one is dealing with underdevelopment, rather than poverty. It would be useless to impose a poverty line if money was rarely used as the medium of exchange, work was not paid by wages, and food supply was made through hunting or people were living off their farming life in precivilized societies. What should be needed in these societies is not to eradicate poverty, but to help them to take up modern life in preparation for possible economic progress.</p>
<p>One can conclude that the lack of economic development could be the reason for the higher level of income inequality among developing countries. Very often, the modern form of employment could not increase and mobility could not occur if the level of economic development was below a certain threshold level. For example, economic openness has been considered as an important element in economic development (Li and Zhou, 2010). A certain level of industrialization and infrastructure achievement are needed before employment can occur and income can increase, which in turn could have multiplying impact on upward mobility. Indeed, it is the reduction of poverty that is more curcial than the lessening of income inequality. Ultimately, it is economic growth that will reduce poverty, though in the process of poverty reduction there is the possibility of creating income inequality. The rise in income should permit mobility, but while it can generate inequality in the process, the more important principle is the equality in opportunity.</p>
<p>There are several messages provided by the analysis on economic opportunity. In addition to the scarcity in porduction factor, it is often not the availability of production factors that governed growth, but how the productions factors are used, along with other supporting factors, such as infrastructure provision, business-friendly government, reliable institutions, macroeconomic stability, and so on. The production factors merely show the ‘width’ in economic opportunity analysis, but they cannot explain why growth differed among countries with similar backgrounds in the provision of production factors. Collectively, economic opportunity reflects the ‘depth’ at which production factors are being used in the process of growth.</p>
<p>In short, a ‘demand-led’ approach to redistribution is an unsustainable policy that may have short-term alleviation, but the long-term damage is huge. The problem would be made worse when poor economic performance leads to unwanted and unintended political consequences that can have further destructive effects on the economy.</p>
<p>Given that any market economy cannot avoid the role of government, the more appropriate question is what the government can do in order to effectively and productively promote the economy so that economic competitiveness can be maintained, and economic capacity and capability can be enlarged. The intuition of the ‘supply-led’ approach is that spending by the government will give rise to other productive activities so as to expand the output multiplier. The essence in the ‘supply-led’ approach is that the government will indirectly assist to strengthen the individual in three different aspects. One aspect is to enhance the individual’s market potential through establishing a market-friendly policy. Another aspect is to enhance the individuals’ ability through the provision of adequate training and education, so that the individual can have stronger endowment. The third aspect is the provision of public goods and utilities so as to reduce the survival cost of individuals, and in turn maximize the purchasing power of individuals in ensuring a higher level of living standard.</p>
<p>There are typically three public goods of housing, education, and health that most individuals would find costly. However, one is not arguing for government intervention in these public goods, but some government provision could reduce the difficulties facing individuals. In some economically free and open economies, these goods are provided by the government as well as by the private sector. The ‘dual’ supply enables individuals to have a choice between private or public medical care, and between private and public schools. Housing assistance can be provided to low-income earners, while high-income recipients can have the financial ability to purchase in the private market. A reduction in the individual’s expenses on these public goods can allow them to have greater purchasing power for other private goods, and wages may not need to increase rapidly as their basic necessities are taken care of. Housing typically occupies the largest share of an individual’s savings. The question is whether housing is considered as a necessity or a luxury good. Health expenditure can be high, depending on the physical health of the individual. Education expenses for children can be costly, and parents with low earnings may not have sufficient funds to educate their offspring well, thereby resulting in a possible situation of cross-generational poverty.</p>
<p>The argument that a smaller government is better than a large government is to ensure that the private sector will take the lead in economic activities that maximize output and growth. The more prosperous the private sector is, the less the need for government assistance in terms of social welfare. Government resources can then be used to develop and build up long-term economic capability and capacity through developmental and supply-led activities. However, at all times there are always some endowment-low individuals that suffer from lack of ability to survive economically. Hence, the government will need to exercise a minimum but effective redistributional role, so that the immediate needs of the some endowment-low individuals can be catered for. Economic resources in the hands of the private sector are much better than in the hands of government officials.</p>
<p>Combining the analyses on economics, welfare, and politics, one can conclude that economics is the most useful discipline. When compared with welfare assistance, economics talks not only about the spending side of the equation, but concerns resource deployment and the ability to produce, generate, and enhance economic capability for development. Welfare spending is an easy subject, but the ability to earn is always more difficult. This is true and can be applied to individual persons, individual enterprises or businesses, individual industries, and individual countires. The ability to earn is what an economy needs to generate. Indeed, once individuals have the ability to earn, the spending decision will just follow.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, communism and socialism implies an ideology that used political tools in making economic decisions, or that economics was used as an instrument for political ends. As a result, economic distortions in one aspect of the economy would lead to more distortions in other economic aspects. As private and individual economic decisions were not allowed, individuals in turn would not take up economic responsibilities, and the state would have to bear all the economic burden of ownership, allocation, production, and planning. In other words, households would no longer take up their ‘private costs,’ but these would all be absorbed by the state in the form of ‘social costs.’ As individuals do not need to shoulder their ‘private costs,’ they lost their freedom and choice. As the state had taken over all ‘social costs,’ the state would have the entire authority and power in resource deployment. Individuals lost their freedom at both the input end and the output end in the economic equation.</p>
<p>Economics, in essence, is a process that connects material inputs to produce material outputs. Because societies and individuals possess different material inputs, it naturally will generate differences in material outputs. The society needs to have as much material output as possible in order to promote the standard and quality of life such that everyone will benefit from the rise in economic returns. Thus, capitalism becomes the appropriate political ideology through which the economic maximization of individuals can produce economic maximization of the entre society. In addition to a number of such attributes as economic freedon, intellectural property rights, private ownership and transfer, and a high degree of civility that includes improvement in ethical standards and the rule of law, capitalism permits flexibility and incorporates diversity in economic affairs. Although economic differences are expected, economic flexibility is important because the power to make economic decisions is dispersed among individuals and organizations to go different ways, exploring their greatest potential. Together, they capture new developments and permit progress and technological innovation to take place. This is why creativity, whether it is in advancing technology, environmental protection, making movies, or drawing cartoons, can show its strength in capitalist economies.</p>
<p>In mature capitalist economies, the few endogenous economic problems that arise within the sphere of economic development itself include inequality, externality, competition, and business cycles. Inequality is the result of differences in individual endowments, and the solution to inequality is to adopt economic policies that can enrich individuals’ endowment. Income inequality cannot be eradicated, but the best alternative is to ensure that individuals have the ability to take care of their own welfare. Economic externalities arise as a result of the spillover of one activity on another, and there can be various solutions, including the rule of law, change of locations, compensation, and mutual agreement on settlement. In the case of environmental protection, the solution rests on technological advances and education. One has to be aware that growth should precede protection, as growth allows the creation of wealth, and more resources in turn could be used to protect the environment. This is because many environmental protection activities involve the spending side of the fiscal equation. To ensure that there is no shortage in the revenue side of the fiscal equation means that economic growth has to proceed.</p>
<p>The success of capitalism can be narrowed down to the modern provision of three public goods: housing, health, and education. Unlike welfare provision that involves purely spending and is ‘demand-oriented,’ housing, education, and health provisions are considered as infrastructural investment. When housing is considered as an essential good, provision of public or low cost housing will reduce the survival cost of households, and simultaneously maximize their purchasing power. Education is a public investment and serves as a channel through which individual endowments can be enriched. Similarly, medical services can be costly, and some assistance will help to reduce the survival cost of low income earners. In short, a modern market economy will not only adopt capitalist principles, but focus also on ‘supply-side’ economic areas. Securing these supply-side economic areas, will produce in the long run a more reliable and sustainable economic environment for individuals to attain upward mobility and for businesses to make progress. The remaining issue is how these three supply-side areas should be organized. Housing provisions should first be regarded as a necessity, but the private market will dominate when housing is regarded as an investment. But public and private schools could coexist, so that parents can have a choice in sending their children for the appropriate level of educational achievement. Medical services can be costly, but private hospitals should equally be allowed to operate so that consumers can have a choice in their treatment. Furthermore, private provisions can compete with public provisions, so that checks and balances exist to ensure standards. </p>
<p>Among different ideologies, capitalism is the most sustainable ideology because of its power in economic rejuvenation. It may not be a perfect system, but alternative solutions can often be found within the economic and market mechanisms. In other words, the capitalism engine runs on its own. Capitalism is a system that cherishes individual incentives and hard work, and channels and opportunities are provided for individuals to make progress. Of course, there are both successful and failed cases. Ethically, the capitalism ideology enables the economy to produce more able individuals, and those who succeed should be encouraged and not be penalized, while chances should be provided to the unfortunate ones. A minimum level of welfare assistance can be given to those who are in desperate need. But those successful individuals should look for ways to help others through increases in employment, charity, and donations. Similarly, the market system allows new products to emerge. The ability to rejuvenae or regenerate economic activities through th emergence of new investors and other market players is the most important ingredient in capitalism as this provides renewal, continuity, and sustainability. If not being politicized, economic problems can ultimately be solved using economic instruments.</p>
<p>The world is always changing. Like business cycles at different time periods, some economies rise, stay strong, but face crises and then decline. History tells us that empires and dynasties came and went, often because the over-concentrataion of political and economic power resulted in abuse, malpractice, and ultimately decline. In the modern world, an economy’s natural and resource endowment, production capability, adopted policies, and ideological path are the factors that determine the economy’s sustainability. In the contemporary world, however, one sure thing is that an economically freer and politically more democratic country tends to last and remain sustainable, though there can still exist business cycles and periodic crises, resulting from changes of expectations in supply and demand trends.</p>
<p>Ultimately, economic development is shaped by an economy’s ideology, which can be considered and judged by the four key aspects of resources, policy, leadership, and systems. An economy’s resources are one major aspect in the deployment of ideology as it governs the economic life of the country. Resources go beyond natural resources of land and raw materials, and include availability and quality of human resources, conditions to attract inflow of resources, ability to increase the ‘value-added’ content of resources, and technological capability that enhances the value and effectiveness of other resources. The second aspect in the component of an economy’s ideology is the policies that are adopted to deploy the resources to produce results. Due to contrasting ends, no one policy could cater for all needs, and there has to be a combination of policies that work through different aspects to minimize problems and maximize results. Policies on infrastructure development, medical support, and the promotion of education, e.g., have to be complemented with policies that enhance business development, technological advancement, and development in peace and civilization.</p>
<p>Leadership is another crucial element in an economy’s ideology. An economy’s leaders need to show great understanding of resources deployment and policy orientations. Political leaders have to be different from business leaders, as the former maximize societal results and outcomes, while the latter maximize individual wealth and business assets. Political leaders are meant to serve, and are not supposed to take advantage of their position for vested interests. As it could be easy to rip the benefit from the leadership position, the integrity of the leader should be the paramount consideration in ensuring maximum utilization of resouces and appropriate deployment of policies. One should not forget that it often will be the people around the leader, who are not acountable, that make policy proposals to the leaders. The establishment of a reliable and dynamic civic system will serve as a monitor over the leaders, so that no one will be above the law, and every wrongdoing will be brought to justice.</p>
<p>These components of an economy’s ideology will reflect the fact that there are always human errors. As such, there cannot be a perfect ideology, but it is important to identify a functioning and effective ideology that adheres to freedom, allows activities to be organized more by individuals, and allows individuals to be in charge of their own welfare. When compared to other political ideologies and civic systems, capitalism proves to be the appropriate channel through which economic activities will be in the hands of individuals, will produce a minimal but effective government, and will promote business-friendliness to maximize economic opportunities, then economic rejuvenation and revitalization will emerge through the decisions of individuals after the outbreak of economic crises. An examination of the key data of the global economy will allow new interpretation of the global economy, and that insightful analysis will bring new foresight to the next stage in the capitalist development of the global economy.</p>
<p>Expansion in industries and services give rise to consumption and improvements in living standards. The final stage arrives with the Age of Mass Consumption, where modern services would be the dominant economic sector, supported by industries as the second largest economic sector, while agriculture remains as the smallest economic sector. Using A, I and S to represent agriculture, industry, and services, respectively, the movements of the three economic sectors in the five stages of economic development are: ASI, AIS, IAS, ISA, and SIA. In the first stage, the dominance of agriculture is followed by service as the second most important sector, while industry is the weakest sector. Hence, between the five stages, agriculture that dominated at the beginning drops to become the least important sector. Industries were least important in the beginning, and flourished in the later stage, but were overtaken by services. Services have been transformed from the primitive activities to the modern form of services. In the process, serviced climbed to become the dominant economies sector after transformation.</p>
<p>Labor abundance in China helped its development in light manufacturing industries for the export market. Studies have shown that capital input has been the key factor in China’s total factor productivity in the postre form years (Li and Liu, 2001). Due to China’s richness in resources, and probably influenced by centuries of Confucianism, the spirit of entrepreneurship, hard work, and self-reliance are the ‘bulit-in’ features in China. This is particularly strong in the coastal provinces, where economic openness to the external world had traditionally led businesses to flourish. China’s socialism was considered to be ‘short-lived,’ and since 1978, the market economy has been reestablished. In the early years of reform, the Chinese economy made much use of funds and loans from international institutions and foreign governments. The foreign funds could supplement infrastructural dvelopment in the domestic economy, while domestic funds would be freed and deployed to politically preferred activities. China’s growth benefitted from both the external sources of funds and domestic deployment of funds. Economic growth was accompanied by policy reforms, such as price and industry reform in the 1980s, banking and state-owned enterprises reform in the 1990s, and trade reform that resulted in accession to th World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 (Li, 1999, 2000, 2001). Due to its rapid development tough many foreign importers found that the quality of Chinese exports was often questionable. By 2010, China had boosted itself to be the second largest economy in the world after the United States (Overholt, 1993; Kroeber, 2016).</p>
<p>‘Supply-side’ economics is still the more reliable and sustainable solution to economic development. One can not keep demanding, asking and taking, though this is easier to do, the economy cannot survive without production, accumulation, and supply. While demand is unavoidable, the economy has to devote more resources to the ‘supply-side’ of the economic equation. Supply creates jobs, employment, output, and productivity. Demand requires one to spend, buy, shop, and use. The best combination would be to produce and consume one’s product and output, so that job creation can be kept, and a rise in employment be provided by the purchasing power of the employed. The economy would engage in a virtuous cycle of production and job creation. The worst combination would be the inability to produce domestically, but assistance from foreign funds would allow one to consume. With the absence of local output, goods would have to be imported. The economy would face the need to repay the foreign assistance, and foot the import bill, while domestic employment would become low if the production sector remained weak.</p>
<p>The lack of foreign investment has to do partly with declining international role that Taiwan faces, as Taiwan lost its seat to mainland China in the United Nations. Since then, Taiwan has been faced with a ‘two-front’ political pressure from mainland China across the strait, and from within Taiwan. Packaged in the ‘Nixon-Kissinger initiative’, the complicated diplomatic relationship between the United States, China, and Taiwan led to the US pledging for a ‘one China policy’ in 1972, which, according to the US State Department, states that ‘Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait maintain that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.’ Beijing acknowledges that ‘the American people will continue to carry on commercial, cultural and other unofficial contacts with the people of Taiwan.’ Implicitly, the United States acknowledges that the territories are governed by two seperate and legitimate governments. Such a diplomatic outcome enabled Taiwan to maintain its status quo. </p>
