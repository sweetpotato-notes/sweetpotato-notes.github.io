        <p>A Critique of welfare economics and the implications for public policy</p>
<p>The Author<br>Professor Cheung’s main approach to research is empirical – he formulates hypotheses and then tests their implications against evidence. His conviction of the importance of property rights in affecting economic behaviour has led to an almost exclusive focus on various aspects of transaction costs. As a price theorist, Professor Cheung typically specifies alternative sets of transaction costs in deriving his hypotheses, and then proceeds to test the implications through thorough investigations of the real-world situations.</p>
<p>Transaction costs may arise as a consequence of </p>
<ul>
<li>first, the inadequate specification of property rights;</li>
<li>second, the nature of the externality;</li>
<li>third, the number of bargarners; and / or</li>
<li>fourth, the inadequacy of the institutions</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Inadequate definition of property rights<br>Without this initial delimitation of property rights, there will be no market transactions – exchange or ‘trade’ – to transfer and recombine them. A clear-cut decision on property rights may thus itself be all that is required to resolve the difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Uncertain effect of externality<br>Where the externality itself is complex and even ambiguous, so that the individuals do not know whether an activity is detrimental or beneficial to themselves, it is impossible to strike a bargain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Bargaining costs<br>Transaction costs may frequently increase with the number of individuals both as a result of increased difficulties in locating all involved and of accurately revealing their preferences.<br>On the assumption of zero transaction costs, Professor Coase argued that the efficient solution would be attained by bargaining irrespective of the initial delimitation of rights. Once there are transaction costs, the effects are less clear-cut.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Failure of legal and political institutions<br>Finally, the transaction costs of resolving an externality problem may be high as a consequence of inadequae institutions. Inevitably, this issue has dominated the debate on policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The most obvious instrument of policy, once property rights are established and bargaining has failed, is court action. In an ideal world, it would suffice. But, in practice, British courts are less than helpful.</p>
<p>Fundamental issues<br>First, no-one should expect that governments will behave simply as social agencies whose sole or primary purpose is to maximise welfare.<br>Second, the evidence is mounting that government sector interventions are themselves excessively costly. The costs of intervention will often exceed the benefits.<br>Third, government should not be assumed to command more knowledge than the individuals affected.<br>Fourth, the implications for individual freedom should not be ignored when assessing the argument for government interention.</p>
<p>On ethics, economic theory must remain silent: no testable propositions can be put forward unless each individual’s judgement is accepted as given. In the seemingly persuasive argument for redistribution of income, economic analysis has failedo produce a convincing measure of a net improvement in ‘welfare’ when $1 of every $100 is taken from one person and given to another.</p>
<p>To accept or to deny the desirability of a public policy necessarily involves ‘normative’ value-judgements on whether it should (or should not) be adopted. Economic efficiency, on the other hand, can be defined in ‘positive’ terms concerned with whether a certain activity is (or is not) efficient. The transition from positive analysis to normative argument on policy requires only the inference that efficient allocation of resources is desirable to society. This inference is easy to draw and, to most economists, easy to accept.</p>
<p>The disagreements usually stem not from conflicting analytical tools but rather from different assumptions. </p>
<p>Pareto condition: a state where it is no longer possible to re-allocate the use of resources so that one individual will gain without loss to another.</p>
<p>The term ‘economic efficiency’ in its standard usage refers to the attainment of maximum aggregate value of goods and services, or maximum value of the scarce resources used to produce them.</p>
<p>A central postulate in economic analysis is that each individual will maximise his real income (or gain) subject to limitations or ‘constraints’, the term used here to include all the factors which restrain an individual from achieving an infinitely high income. They comprise four groups:<br>(1) scarcity of resources;<br>(2) diminishing returns – nature’s law which dictates that one cannot produce an infinite quantity of grain by continuing to add fertilizer to a given piece of land;<br>(3) property rights, which stem from competition for the same resources;<br>(4) transaction costs, which include the costs of searching, negotating and enforcing contracts, and of defining and policing of rights.</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe always efficient</p>
<p>The validity of assumptions in economic analysis has been a confusing issue. An ‘assumption’ sometimes refers to a postulate which cannot be observed, and it is pointless then to question its reality.</p>
<p>Assuming constraints that fail to conform essentially to reality has been a major fallacy in the analysis of social cost.</p>
<p>In Coase’s view therefore, the problem is a reciprocal one, and on efficiency grounds the solution is not simply to restrain the damaging party, but to restrain either the damaging or the damaged party in such a way that the gain for one side cannot be outweighted by the loss to the other, in total and at the margin.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for the consummation of any transaction is that the maximum one party is willing to pay to acquire a right is more than, or at least equal to, the minimum another party is willing to accept to surrender that right.</p>
<p>A more general statement can now be made regarding the constraints under which the traditional measure of economic efficiency will be attained.<br>First, assignment of exclusive rights to either A or B is essential, and either case will yield similar result.<br>(The alternative assignments of rights, involving alternative liability rules and different distributions of wealth, could lead to different patterns of resource use due to the distribution effects, but this would not affect efficiency.)<br>A second constraint is that all costs associated with making transactions ar zero.<br>These two propositions summarise what has been called the Coase theorem.</p>
<p>Complications</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncertain transaction costs<br>Either party may capture the entire amount; but no criterion or mechanism is specified through which a division may be determined, and without an answer to this question we cannot predict the behavior of the individual parties.<br>Bilateral monopoly<br>The important conclusion is that the solution becomes mechanical once the nature and magnitude of transaction costs, together with other constraints, are sufficiently specified.</li>
<li>High transaction costs<br>If transaction costs are prohibitive or even sizeable, the arbitrary assignment of rights influences the use of resources and the gain to society.<br>The mere attainment of a contract, therefore, is not a priori evidence of a move toward more efficient use of resources; conversely, the absence of contracting may enhance efficiency.<br>Indeed, even if the costs of private contracting were insignificant, a government might still decide to intervene. Economic analysis has thu far failed to predict the circumstances under which government action will incur lower (or higher) costs than those resulting from private contracting.</li>
<li>Absence of diminishing returns<br>This complication demonstrates not only that alternative assignments of rights may affect resource allocation when the transaction costs are positive, but also that the transaction costs incurred may vary with alternative assignments of rights.</li>
<li>Unlimited property rights / prohibitive transaction costs</li>
</ol>
<p>No hard line seperates limitations of rights which are matters of private contracting from those which fall withinn the jurisdiction of the court or the coercion of government. (Indeed, the very definition of ‘government’ is itself still subject to debate and conjecture.) But whatever government is, its economic role in society must remain unclear until we can pinpoint the activities where governmental intervention incurs lower costs than private contracting.</p>
<p>In specifying the constraints sufficient to yield testable implications for the interpretation of behaviour, two requirements must be met.<br>First, the constraints must be identifiable by observation. Thus, any empirically useful definition of property rights must provide observable situations where changes in rights occur.<br>A second requirement, if property rights are to be useful in economic theorising, is that they be defined in such a way that (given constrained maximisation) changes in behaviour can be derived as a result of changes of rights.</p>
<p>A good or an asset is defined to be private property if, and only if, three distinct sets of rights are associated with its ownership.<br>First, the exclusive right to use (or to decide how to use) the good may be viewed as the right to exclude other individuals from its use.<br>Second is the exclusive right to receive income generated by the use of the good.<br>Third, the full right to transfer, or freely ‘alienate’, its ownership includes the right to enter into contracts and to choose their form.<br>This structure of rights which defines private property is, of course, an idealisation intended for economic theorising; in practice, exclusivity and transferability are matters of degree.</p>
<p>If behaviour is to be interpreted in terms of economic principles, the most basic requirement is that we be able to identify any changing pattern of these rights so that implications can be derived for corresponding changes in contractual behaviour, resource allocation, and income distribution.</p>
<p>In the broadest sense of the term, ‘transaction costs’ comprise those that cannot be conceived to exist in a Crusoe economy.<br>The term then includes not only the costs of forming and enforcing contracts (including seeking information for market transactions), but also the costs of delineating and policing exclusive rights (including those of institutional arrangements such as legislative enactments). This wide definition is essential, for it is difficult (and, insofar as we know, impossible) to separate the cost of exchange from the cost of defining rights to the resource to be exchanged. </p>
<p>A more useful method, of course, is to propose generalised functions of transaction costs which may be systematically applied to a larger number of situations. This task is onerous, as the current state of the art amply demonstrates.</p>
<p>The issue if not divergence itself, but the reliability of the observations used to illustrate it. If to a significant extent these observations are untrue, economists have tried to explain things which do not exist and have formulated policies largely inappropriate for application.</p>
<p>J. L. Buck<br>Contrary to the prevailing opinion that tenants do not farm as well as owners, a classification according to yields by different types of tenure shows no significant variation in yields for most localities, and for the few in which a difference does occur, it is in favour of the tenant or part-owner as often as for the owner…. In some places, even, it is evident that the tenants farm better than the owners.</p>
<p>The lack of significant variation between owner and tenant cultivation in the data presented does not imply that the costs of negotiating and enforcing tenant contracts in China or elsewhere are trivial, or that they will not affect observations in some decisive ways. But, while recognising these transaction costs, we must not jump to the conclusion that tenant farming will be less productive than owner farming.<br>Whether transaction costs will significantly affect behaviour depends upon their impact on resource use at the margin. With or without such costs, maximisation may imply the same marginal equality: namely, for the use of crucial farming resources the marginal return to the input committed equals its marginal opportunity cost.<br>It is true that transaction costs incurred are generally higher with tenant than with owner cultivation, but there is no reason to predict that they are of such proportion or nature that they significantly affect resource use at the crucial margin.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to estimate the standard sets of marginal values which an efficient market is said to equate: the burden of such a task must rest upon those who believe the government can costlessly and accurately make these estimates for the imposition of the ‘ideal’ tax-subsidy schemes.</p>
<p>But any government action can be speciously justified on efficiency grounds by the simple expedient of assuming that transaction costs in the market are high and that costs of governmental control are low.</p>
<p>The common fallacies are that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the constraints assumed have largely been invalid</li>
<li>the observations reported have often been incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p>The thesis here is simply that any valuable application of economic theory must rest upon careful empirical investigation to ensure that the facts are true, that the hypotheses are testable, and that the tests are performed.</p>
<p>Analyses designed to assist policy-making need not be inconsistent with those designed to interpret behaviour.</p>
<p>It is always possible in principle to define (i.e., set up) a system of private rights in property. But in some cases it would still be prohibitively expensive for the owners to police and enforce their rights, given the technical difficulties.</p>
<p>John Burton<br>What conclusions may we draw for public policy?<br>First, the Pigovian policy rule – that externalities necessitate ‘corrective’ government action – is dangerously over-simplistic. It is incorrect as a general rule for efficiency in resource allocation. Its application often leads to a more serious misallocation of resources than that arising from the externalities which government action is supposed to correct.<br>Second the Pigovian analysis contains an implicit bias towards ‘intervention solutions’ for externalities, in the form of taxes, subsidies, regulations and prohibitions.<br>Third, recognition of the fundamental role of attenuations of private property rights in generating externalities leads to consideration of the alternative policy of re-defining property rights. The advantages of this approach are that it harnesses the incentives for individuals, and the relative cheapness of the price system as a means of generating and utilising information, in the interests of conservation.<br>A private property approach is not applicable in all instances, but insufficient attention has been paid in the past to the possibilities of applying it.</p>
<p>The general conclusion for public policy is the classical one:<br>given the inherent defects, complexity, cost and bias of an intervention solution, the general rule should be to let the price system deal with externalities wherever possible: by re-defining property rights and removing barriers to trade due to externalities. Government intervention – domestic or supramational – is best kept as a ‘solution of the last resort’: to be used only when and where high and irreducible transaction costs prevent the internalisation of externalities by private action. Even on these grounds, government intervention must be carefully scrutinised, because the costs and external side effects may outweigh the benefits.<br>The mere existence of externalities thus does not, despite Professor Samuelson, provide ‘a clear case for some kind of public intervention’.</p>
