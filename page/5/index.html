        <p>Theory is valuable, however, in that it allows the development of a set of principles that can be used to untangle the web of different forces involved in social problems. Principles will then develop into a framework for thinking. We might call this way of thinking the economic approach.</p>
<p>Economic theorists make assumptions that simplify a problem and then develop a theoretical model that will yield a testable hypothesis. This hypothesis can then be checked by appealing to the facts.</p>
<p>Most economists would agree that the importance  of assumptions in theory is that they allow the model specified to be logically consistent and to express the fundamental aspects of any social process. For most economists, an important way of judging theory is to consider how well it predicts behavior vis-a-vis alternative theories.</p>
<p>Perhaps our most basic assumption in economics is that people behave in a selfish, self-interested manner.</p>
<p>A short guide to the economic approach</p>
<ol>
<li>Economic theory is positive, or nonnormative; that is, it consists of a set of refutable propositions about ‘what is’ rather than individual, normative value judgments about ‘what ought to be.’</li>
<li>Economic theory cannot predict the future but can only explain the consequences of certain occurrences.</li>
<li>Economists tend to look to private market processes for solutions to social problems.</li>
<li>Economists tend to spend a great deal of effort clarifying options and making the cost of a given choice as clear as possible.</li>
<li>Economists are likely to recognize the opportunity for substitution among options that exists.</li>
<li>A closely related point is that economists employ an incremental or marginal approach.</li>
<li>Economists tend to take an individualistic approach to social analysis; that is, they regard the decisions and behavior of individuals as an important influence on the formulation of public policy and the organization of the economy.</li>
<li>Economic theory is applicable to all economic systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resources of any society, which represent all the inputs that can be used to produce goods and services, are scarce.</p>
<p>The basic institution needed for the market resolution to work is the institution of property rights. Markets and exchange will happen only if individual buyers and sellers possess the property rights to the goods and services they exchange.</p>
<p>Law of demand:<br>The quantity demanded of a good or service is an inverse function of its price, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>The (not quite) law of supply:<br>The quantity supplied of a good or service is usually a positive function of price, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>In other words,<br>demand curves always have a negative slope and<br>supply curves almost always have a positive slope.</p>
<p>The principle of diminishing marginal utility holds that for a given time period, the greater the level of consumption of a particular commondity, the lower the marginal utility.</p>
<p>The word monopoly is derived from the Greek words mono for ‘one’ and poly for ‘seller.’ Monopoly is thus the market structure in which the firm is a single seller of a product that has no close substitutes.</p>
<p>When the demand curve facing monopolist shifts, the profit-maximizing position will shift, so we can’t predict output or price unless we know the exact nature of the shift in demand. In this sense, the monopolist has no supply curve.</p>
<p>Oligopoly, the other form of imperfect competition, is the market structure in which there are few firms. ‘Oligopoly’ comes from the Greek words for ‘few’ and ‘sellers.’ The scarity of sellers is the key to firm behavior in oligopoly.</p>
<p>A license fee on the monopolist will be viewed as a fixed cost and will increase average cost but not marginal cost. In this way, the monopoly profit can be taxed away with no effect on output.</p>
<p>Social Darwinism applied Charles Darwin’s theory of the evolution of the species, often summed up (and simplified) as a belief in the survival of the fittest, to business enterprise. Under that view stronger firms were justified in getting bigger by ‘gobbling up’ the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Regulation of monopoly leads to cost-plus pricing, which destroys cost minimizing incentives. Taxation of monopoly does not destroy these incentives, but it does not change the monopoly price and output.</p>
<p>In bilateral monopoly, a monopolistic seller, the union, sells labor to a monopsony firm. The wage rate will be logically indeterminate, depending on the relative bargaining strengths of the two participants.</p>
<p>The Coase theorem show how externalities are internalized by the assignment of property rights.</p>

        <p>The foundation of political economy and, in general, of every social science, is evidently psychology. A day may come when we shall be able to deduce the laws of social science from the principles of psychology. – Vilfredo Pareto, 1906</p>
<p>The core premise of economic theory is that people choose by optimizing.</p>
<p>This premise of constrained optimization, that is, choosing the best from a limited budget, is combined with the other major workhorse of economic theory, that of equilibrium. In competitive markets where prices are free to move up and down, those prices fluctuate in such a way that supply equals demand.</p>
<p>To simplify somewhat, we can say that<br>Optimization + Equilibrium = Economics<br>This is a powerful combination, nothing that other social sciences can match. </p>
<p>There is, however, a problem: the premises on which economic theory rests are flawed.<br>First, the optimization problems that ordinary people confront are often too hard for them to solve, or even come close to solving.<br>Second, the beliefs upon which people make their choices are not unbiased. Overconfidence may not be in the economists’ dictionary, but it is a well-established feature of human nature, and there are countless other biases that have been documented by psychologists.<br>Third, there are many factors that the optimization model leaves out, as my story about the 137-point exam illustrates. In a world of Econs, there is a long list of things that are supposedly irrelevant. </p>
<p>The good news is that we do not need to throw away everything we know about how economies and markets work. Theories based on the assumption that everyone is an Econ should not be discarded. They remain useful as starting points for more realistic models. And in some special circumstances, such as when the problems people have to solve are easy or when the actors in the economy have the relevant highly specialized skills, then models of Econs may provide a good approximation of what happens in the real world. But as we will see, those situations are the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Moreover, much of what economists do is to collect and analyze data about how markets work, work that is largely done with great care and statistical expertise, and importantly, most of this research does not depend on the assumption that people optimize.</p>
<p>Two research tools that have emerged over the past twenty-five years have greatly expanded economists’ repertorie for learning about the world.<br>The first is the use of randomized control trial experiments, long used in other scientific fields such as medicine. The typical study investigates what happens when some people receive some ‘treatment’ of interest.<br>The second approach is to use either naturally ocurring experiments (such as when some people are enrolled in a program and others are not) or clever econometrics techniques that manage to detect the impact of treatments even though no one deliberately designed the situation for that purpose.</p>
<p>These studies show that one can learn a lot about the world without imposing optimizing models, and in some cases provide credible evidence against which to test such models and see if they match actual human responses.</p>
<p>We don’t have to stop inventing abstract models that describe the behavior of imaginary Econs. We do, however, have to stop assuming that those models are accurate descriptions of behavior, and stop basing policy decisions on such flawed analyses. And we have to start paying attention to those supposedly irrelevant factors, what I will call SIFs for short.</p>
<p>The field has become known as ‘behavioral economics’. It is not a different discipline: it is still economics, but it is economics done with strong injections of good psychology and other social sciences.</p>
<p>The primary reason for adding Humans to economic theories is to improve the accuracy of the predictions made with those theories.</p>
<p>The opportunity cost of some some activity is what you give up by doing it.<br>Giving up the opportunity to sell something does not hurt as much as taking the money out of your wallet to pay for it. Opportunity costs are vague and abstract when compared to handing over actual cash. Paying a surcharge is out of pocket, whereas not receiving a discount is a “mere” opportunity cost.<br>I called this phenomenon the ‘endowment effect’ because, in economists’ lingo, the stuff you own is part of your endowment, and I had stumbled upon a finding that suggested people valued things that were already part of their endowment more highly than things that could be part of their endowment, that were available but not yet owned.</p>
<p>‘Hindsight bias’: the finding is that, after the fact, we think that we always knew the outcome was likely, if not a foregone conclusion.<br>What makes the bias particularly pernicious is that we all recognize this bias in others but not in ourselves.</p>
<p>Judegement under uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.<br>The thesis of the paper was simple and elegant. Humans have limited time and brainpower. As a result, they use simple rules of thumb-heuristics-to help them make judgments.<br>Using these heuristics causes people to make predictable errors. </p>
<p>A forerunner of Kahneman and Tversky was Herbert Simon, a polymath academic who spent most of his career at Carnegie Mellon University. Simon was well known in nearly every field of social science, including economics, political science, artificial intelligence, and organizational theory, but most germane to this book, he wrote about what he called ‘bounded rationality’ well before Kahneman and Tversky came along.<br>In saying that people have bounded rationality, Simon meant that they lack the cognitive ability to solve complex problems, which is obviously true.</p>
<p>In every case, economic theory had a highly specific prediction about some key factor – such as the presence of the cashews or the amount paid for the basketball game tickets – that the theory said should not influence decisions. They were all supposedly irrelevant factors, or SIFs. Much subsequent work in behavioral economics has been to show which SIFs are in fact highly relevant in predicting behavior, often by taking advantages of the systematic biases suggested in Tversky and Kahneman’s 1974 paper.</p>
<p>The fact that we experience diminishing sensitivity to changes away from the status quo captures another basic human trait – one of the earliest findings in psychology – known as the Weber-Fechner Law. The Weber-Fechner Law holds that the just-noticeable difference (JND) in any variable is proportional to the magnitude of that variable.</p>
<p>The reason why people are risk-seeking for losses is the same logic that applies to why they are risk averse for gains.<br>So, we experience life in terms of changes, we feel diminishing sensitivity to both gains and losses, and losses sting more than equivalently sized gains feel good.</p>
<p>The two central concepts of economics remained the same – namely, that agents optimize and markets reach a stable equilibrium – but economists became more sophisticated in their ability to characterize the optimal solutions to problems as well as to determine the conditions under which a market will reach an equilibrium.</p>
<p>Because learning takes practice, we are more likely to get things right at small stakes than at large stakes. This means critics have to decide which argument they want to apply. If learning is crucial, then as the stakes go up, decision-making quality is likely to go down.</p>
<p>I am ususally pretty good about ignoring sunk costs, especailly if the sunk costs are purely monetary in nature. But like most people, if I have put a lot of work into some project I can find it difficult to give it up, even if it is clearly the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Like most aspects of mental accounting, setting up non-fungible budgets is not entirely silly. Be it with mason jars, envelops, or sophisticated financial apps, a household that makes a serious efforts to create a financial plan will have an easier time living within its means.</p>
<p>A good rule to remember is that people who are threatened with big losses and have a chance to break even will be unusually willing to take risks, even if they are normally quite risk averse. Watch out!</p>
<p>To understand the consumption behavior of households, we clearly need to get back to studying Humans rather than Econs. Humans do not have the brains of Einstern (or Barro), nor do they have the self-control of an ascetic Buddhist monk. Rather, they have passions, faulty telescopes, treat various pots of wealth quite diferently, and can be influenced by short-run returns in the stock market. We need a model of these kinds of Humans.</p>
<p>As usual in these cases when demand has suddenl risen, a seller has to trade off short-term gain against possible long-term loss of good will, which can be hard to measure.</p>
<p>But any large first mover who takes ac action that violates the norms of fairness runs considerable risks if competitors do not follow suit.</p>
<p>‘If you gouge them at Christmas they won’t come back in March.’ That remains good advice for any business that is interested in building a loyal clientele.</p>
<p>‘It is incredibly important for any business, no matter how great the demand, not to charge a customer more than the good or service is worth – even if the customer is willing to pay more.’</p>
<p>A large proportion of people can be categorized as conditional cooperators, meaning that they are willing to give their fellow players the benefit of the doubt, but if coopration rates are low, these conditional cooperation cooperators turn into free riders.</p>
<p>Losses are roughly twice as painful as gains are pleasurable, a finding that has been replicated numerous times over the years.</p>
<p>The endowment effect experiments show that people have a tendency to stick with what they have, at least in part because of loss aversion.</p>
<p>Loss aversion and status quo bias will often work together as forces that inhibit change.</p>
<p>It is much easier to detect that we may be in a bubble than it is to say when it will pop, and investors who attempt to make money by timing market turns are rarely successful.</p>
<p>Without the rational framework, there are no anomalies from which we can detect misbehavior. Furthermore, there is not as yet a benchmark behavioral theory of asset prices that could be used as a theoretical underpinning of empirical research. We need some starting point to organize our thoughts on any topic, and the EMH remains the best one we have.</p>
<p>There are definitely anomalies: sometimes the market overreacts, and sometimes it underreacts. But it remains the case that most active money managers fail to beat the market. And as the story about Royal Dutch Shell and LTCM shows, even when investors can know for sure that prices are wrong, these prices can still stay wrong, or even get more wrong. This should rightly scare investors who think they are smart and want to exploit apparent mispricing. It is possible to make money, but it is not easy. Certainly, investors who accept the EMH gospel and invest in low-cost index funds cannot be faulted for that choice.</p>
<p>Instead of expecting mean reversion, people were acting as if what goes up must go up even more.</p>
<p>Five findings from the psychology of decision-making supported our hypothesis that early picks will be too expensive:</p>
<ol>
<li>People are overconfident</li>
<li>People make forecasts that are too extreme</li>
<li>The winner’s curse</li>
<li>The false consensus effect</li>
<li>Present bias</li>
</ol>
<p>A nudge is some smal feature in the environment that attracts out attention and influences behavior.’</p>
<p>If you want people to comply with some norm or rule, it is a good strategy to inform them (if true) that most other people comply.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to encourage someone to do something, make it easy.</li>
<li>We can’t do evidence-based policy without evidence.<br>分享： </li>

        <p>Libertarian paternalism</p>
<p>Improving Decisions about health, wealth, and happiness</p>
<p>Simply by rearranging the cafeteria, Carolyn was able to increase or decrease the consumption of many food items by as much as 25 percent. Carolyn learned a big lesson: school children, like adults, can be greatly influenced by small changes in the context. The influence can be exercised for better or for worse.</p>
<p>A choice architect has the responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions.</p>
<p>As we shall see, small and apparently insignificant details can have major impacts on people’s behavior. A good rule of thumb is to assume that ‘everything matters’.</p>
<p>‘Libertarian paternalism’ is a relatively weak, soft, and nonintrusive type of paternalism because choices are not blocked, fenced off, or significantly burdened.</p>
<p>A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.</p>
<p>Nudges are not mandates.</p>
<p>Hundreds of studies confirm that human forecasts are flawed and biased. Human decision making is not so great either.</p>
<p>For a host of reasons, which we shall explore, people have a strong tendency to go along with the status quo or default option.</p>
<p>Two important lessons can be drawn from this research. First, never underestimate the power of inertia. Second, that power can be harnessed. As we will show, setting default options, and other similar seemingly trivial menu-changing strategies, can have huge effects on outcomes, from increasing savings to improving health care to providing organs for lifesaving transplant operations.</p>
<p>In accordance with our definition, a nudge is any factor that significantly alters the behavior of Humans, even though it would be ignored by Econs.</p>
<p>The false assumption is that almost all people, almost all of the time, make choices that are in their best interest or at the very least are better than the choices that would be made by someone else.</p>
<p>The first misconception is that it is possible to avoid influencing people’s choices. The second misconception is that paternalism always involves coercion.</p>
<p>Automatic system and reflective system</p>
<p>Rules of thumb<br>Their original work identified three heuristics, or rules of thumb – anchoring, availability, and representativeness – and the biases that are associated with each.</p>
<p>Unrealistic optimism is a pervasive feature of human life; it characterizes most people in most social categories. When they overestimate their personal immunity from harm, people may fail to take sensible preventive steps.</p>
<p>People are ‘loss averse’.</p>
<p>The combination of loss aversion with mindless choosing implies that if an option is designated as the ‘default’, it will attract a large market share. Default options thus act as powerful nudges.</p>
<p>Framing works because people tend to be somewhat mindless, passive decision makers. Their reflective system does not do the work that would be required to check and see whether reframing the questions would produce a different answer.</p>
<p>We will call something ‘tempting’ if we consume more of it when hot than when cold.</p>
<p>When self-control problems and mindless choosing are combined, the result is a series of bad outcomes for real people.</p>
<p>Humans are not exactly lemmings, but they are easily influenced by the statements and deeds of others.</p>
<p>Social influences come in two basic categories. The first involves information. The second involves peer pressure.</p>
<p>The moral is that people are paying less attention to you than you believe. If you have a stain on your shirt, don’t worry, they probably won’t notice. But in part because people do think that everyone has their eyes fixed on them, they conform to what they think people expect.</p>
<p>In particular, advertisers are entirely aware of the power of social influences. They try to nudge you by telling you what most people are now doing.</p>
<p>Boomerang effect<br>If you want to nudge people into socially desirable behavior, do not, by any means, let them know that their current actions are better than the social norm.</p>
<p>The ‘mere-measurement effect’ refers to the finding that when people are asked what they intend to do, they become more likely to act in accordance with their answers.</p>
<p>The three social influences that we have emphasized – information, peer pressure, and priming – can easily be enlisted by private and public nudgers.</p>
<p>If you indirectly influence the choices oher people make, you are a choice architect. And since the choices you are influencing are going to be made by Humans, you will want your architecture to reflect a good understanding of how humans behave.</p>
<p>All these forces imply that if, for a given choice, there is a default option – an option that will obtain if the chooser does nothing – then we can expect a large number of people to end up with that option, whether or not it is good for them.</p>
<p>When choices are highly complex, required choosing may not be a good idea; it might not even be feasible.</p>
<p>Humans make mistakes. A well-designed system expects its users to err and is as forgiving as possible. </p>
<p>The best way to help Humans improve their performance is to provide feedback. Well-designed systems tell people when they are doing well and when they are making mistakes.</p>
<p>President Bush told a clubhouse of Florida seniors in 2006, with the plan’s rollout under way: ‘The more choices you have, the more likely it is you’ll be able to find a program that suits your specific needs. In other words, one-size-fits-all is not a consumer-friendly program. And I believe in consumers, I believe in trusting people’.</p>
<p>The more choices there are, and the more complex the situation, the more important it is to have enlightened choices architecture. To produce a user-friendly design, the architect needs to understand how to help Humans.</p>
<p>In this book we have made two major claims. The first is that seemingly small features of social situations can have massive effects on people’s behavior; nudges are everywhere, even if we do not see them. Choice architecture, both good and bad, is pervasive and unavoidable, and it greatly affects our decisions. Choice archetects can preserve freedom of choice while also nudging people in directions that will improve their lives.</p>
<p>The sheer complexity of modern life, and the astounding pace of technological and global change, undermine arguments for rigid mandates or for dogmatic laissez-faire. Emerging developments should strengthen, at once, the principled commitment to freedom of choice and the case for the gentle nudge.</p>
