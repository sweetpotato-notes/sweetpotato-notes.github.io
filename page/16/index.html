        <p>One of the principal conclusions of that early version of the chapter was the importance of changes in total factor productivity (TFP) in explaining why some countries grew more rapidly than others, and why for a given country some periods exhibited more rapid growth than others.</p>
<p>Follow below equation for economic growth analysis<br>Δy = w×ΔL + ρ×ΔK + R<br>Where<br>y = real net output<br>L = labor force (man-hours)<br>K = real capital stock<br>w = wage<br>ρ = net-of depreciation rate of return to capital<br>Residual R = (MPL-w)×ΔL+(MPK-ρ)×ΔK is the RCR (real cost reduction) or TFP</p>
<p>Two-deflator approach<br>Δy = (w<em>)×(ΔL</em>) + ρ×(ΔK<em>) + R</em><br>In two deflator approach, K* measured in ‘GDP baskets’ generally, or use the consumer price level as numeraire, Pd. In ‘traditional approach’, K measured in investment baskets.<br>In many cases the difference with respect to traditional growth analysis will not be great, but differences with the traditional method are likely to grow in importance as we disaggregate more and more.</p>
<p>For traditional approach, the chosen index would probably be an extremely poor approximation to the relevant true index, creating error bias, and ‘noise’ in the results.</p>
<p>The two deflator approach is characterized:</p>
<p>(1) by the use of a single ‘numerairecum-deflator’ Pd (usually the GDP deflator or the consumer price indexes) to deflate all nominal flows that enter into an exercise in growth analysis,</p>
<p>Δy = ΔΣi(pi/pd)×Xi = Σi(pi/pd)×ΔXi + ΣiXi×Δ(pi/pd)</p>
<p>(2) The use of ‘standard worker’ as the basic unit in which labor is measured and the measurement of any worker’s labor quantum by his total earnings divided by w<em>, the (real) wage of the standard worker.<br>(w</em>)×(ΔL<em>) = (w</em>)×Σi(wi/w<em>)×(ΔLi</em>) + (w<em>)×Σi(ΔLi</em>)×(Δ(wi/w<em>)<br>Comparing residual R’ by traditional approach, two-deflator residual R</em></p>
<p>(a) add a term ΣiXi×Δ(pi/pd) for difference in output</p>
<p>(b) subtract a term ΣhFh×Δ(ph/pd) for the different (non-labor) purchased current input Fh</p>
<p>(c) subtract a term (w<em>)×Σi(ΔLi</em>)×(Δ(wi/w<em>)<br>Each one of these ‘new’ components of the residual fits in neatly with the idea that R</em> measures real cost reduction.</p>
<p>Thus the two deflator approach produces a rather neat package – a growth analysis whose components are in principle easier to measure than those of the traditional approach, and whose measurement is in the overwhelming majority of cases vastly more accurate than that of the traditional approach.</p>
<p>I am skeptical of the use of regression techniques in growth analysis for several reasons. The main one is that, to the degree that technical advance, real cost reduction, TFP improvement, and so forth, really exist and are important, they imply that production functions themselves, at micro- and macro-levels, are undergoing important shifts. Why should we expect these shifts to be so nicely regular that the production function at the end of our period is in some sense or other ‘the same’ as the production function at the beginning. Modern steel processes are very different from those of 50 years ago (and, by the way, have smaller minimum economic scale) – should they somehow fit on the same overall production function for steel, with maybe just a shift of its constant term?</p>
<p>I am skeptical too because of the upward trends of nearly all the key time series in most growth analyses. Output is growing, the labor force is growing, the physical capital stock is growing. If human capital is represented as a separate variable, it too is growing; if it is not so represented, the separate educational categories of the labor force Lj are typically also growing. Multicollinearity abounds; it is practically a natural part of most cases of growth analysis. Stick in a simple trend variable, and it typically will explain almost everything. Add capital and labor to trend (or trend to labor and capital), as explanatory variables, and most or all of the probability levels of the separate coefficients will typically fade into insignificance. Even without trend, capital and labor will often fight each other for explanatory power over output movement, leading to coefficients that seem totally implausible to most economists.</p>
<p>If my broad vision is even roughly correct, turning to estimation in terms of first differences will not help either. Labor force growth is typically quite similar from one year to the next; capital stock growth is less steady, but its big movements are cyclical, and inform us more concerning deviations from the mainline growth path than about the characteristics of that growth path itself.</p>
<p>I am driven by this evidence to a much more Schumpeterian view of the growth process than I used to have. I now know much better the meaning of ‘creative destruction,’ and I see more clearly than ever the cruel but fruitful dynamics of a market economy. I see too why socialist economists and others with lots of state-owned enterprisers run into trouble, especially when they are reluctant to allow losers to go out of business.</p>
<p>In light of this evidence I simply cannot believe that any one or two or three simple causes, like those of endogenous growth theory, really help us understand the forces of real cost reduction and how they work. I feel much more comfortable going back to Schumpeter!</p>
<p>I have always insisted that it was a mistake to focus on the fraction of the growth rate explained, rather than on the percentage rate of TFP increase itself. It is the latter which is the measure of ‘cost reduction effort and success,’ and on this the East Asian countries are clear winners. If at the same time they are also winners in terms of national savings rates, and in terms of the net rate of return that they obtain on invested capital, these are things to be separately applauded. They should not be used to belittle the importance of championship TFP performances. </p>
