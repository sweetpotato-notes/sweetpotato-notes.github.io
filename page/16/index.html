        <p>Wicksell and Fisher<br>Fisher’s quantity theory was basically one of outside money, exogenously determined. Wicksell’s (1898) model of the ‘pure credit economy’ was one with only inside money, endogenously determined.</p>
<p>The reason that Austrian capital theory has not managed to survive in the latter half of the twentieth century, I surmise, is that nonconvexity is absolutely central to it. It is in essence, a translation of Smithian division of labor theory into a sequential temporal context and the productivity of increased roundaboutness is Smithian increasing returns in a somewhat new dress. And increasing returns will not fit in Fisherian IGE theory.</p>
<p>Optimality at individual and competitive equilibrium at aggregate levels are the hallmarks of what we mean by neoclassical theory today.</p>
<p>Book V of Marshall’s Principles is usually regarded as the core of his contribution. That is debatable but what is not debatable is that it survived the longest. Yet, I believe it is most often misunderstood as a seriously flawed version of ‘Modern’ theory. It is more accurately understood as an early attempt at what we today label agent-based economics. Recall that Marshall worked with individual demand-price and supply-price schedules. (This is why he drew his diagrams with quantity on the horizontal axis, etc.) From this, it is obvious that he did not build from choice-theoretical optimization. Instead, the demand-price and supply-price schedules give rise to simple decision-rules that I like to refer to as ‘Marshall’s Laws of Motion.’<br>For consumers: if demand-price exceeds market price, increase consumption; in the opposite case, cut back.<br>For producers: if supply-price exceeds the price realized, reduce output; in the opposite case, expand.<br>For middlemen: if inventory turnover slows down, reduce prices to both the customers and suppliers; in the opposite case, raise them.</p>
<p>Please note for future reference that, if all this is going on at once, God only knows what kind of messy nonlinear dynamics would result. Marshall tamed the dynamics by assuming a strong ranking of adjustment speeds that gave him a tidy ordering of market day, short-run and long-run equilibria. These equilibria, of course, have no counterparts in choice-theoretically based modern constructions.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t the system ‘automatically’ straighten itself out? Because, Keynes maintained, saving is not an effective demand for future consumer goods and the offer of unemployed labor to work is not an effective demand for present consumer goods. Effective excess demands summed across all markets do not necessarily sum to zero. In this sense, therefore, Say’s Law does not hold: Supply cannot be counted on to create its own demand. So, from the rejection of Say’s Law, stems the original rationale for stabilization policy, understood as aggregate demand management.<br>But Keynes did not get everything right and besides he was not generally well-understood.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, mainstream economists believe that the economy maintains itself on an intertemporal equilibrium path. As long as they are not disturbed by stupid policies, markets will take care of all coordination problems. The coordinated timepath may be somewhat less than ideal. If labor market ‘inflexibilities’ are tolerated, the natural rate of unemployment may be quite high. And governments are seen as prone to excessive deficits and inflationary finance, as constitutionally time-inconsistent, and as addicted to playing the unstable Phillips-curve for no good reason and to no good effect. Macropolicy no longer means the active management of aggregate demand, but rather the political art of finding ways to constrain governments.</p>
<p>First, one should perhaps mention some beliefs that Keynes held that present-day economist (at least in the first world) have little reason to share. Among them (1) the belief inherited from Richardo, Marx, and Marshall that the accumulation of capital would sooner or later depress the marginal efficiency of capital to near zero. Also (2) the conviction that the modern economy has a chronic tendency to save more than could be profitably invested. Furthermore (3) the view that workers live more or less hand-to-mouth, so that consumption is simply a function of current income.</p>
<p>His 1967 Presidential Address (Friedman, 1968) became a pivotal contribution. Hailed by many as the most important paper in the second half of the century, the theory advanced in it had two main components that need to be considered separately.</p>
<p>The first component is, again, the role of inflation expectations returning here as the source of the instability of the Philips locus. If money is neutral and if expectations adapt to (or anticipate) inflation, then higher growth rates of money should shift the locus upwards. So it should be ‘unstable’ in relation to variations in the growth rate of outside (neutral) money. Friedman’s theory gained immense prestige when the inflation of the 1970s verified its predictions that higher inflation would raise nominal interest rates and prove the Philips curve to be unstable.<br>In retrospect, the American inlfation decade has come to seem an exceptional episode. The Philips curve seemed ‘stable’ (although the criteria are less than clear) before and has regained an appearance of stability as the memory of the inflation has faded. Similarly, the idea that an expansionary monetary policy would raise (nominal) interest rates was a commonplace in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but by the 1990s the old central bank verities had returned – easy moentary policy meant lower, not higher, interest rates. The Monetarist theory that won out over Keynesianism in the early 1970s, and the basic properties of which were brought into sharper focus in the Monetarist Rational Expectations model of the ensuing decade, runs into empirical trouble when applied to data before or after its heyday.</p>
<p>The second component of Friedman’s famous paper was, of course, the ‘natural rate of unemployment.’ Friedman defined the concept but Edmund Phelps (1967, 1968) earned the priority for providing a micro-founded model with the natural rate property. The two components – endogenous inflation expectations and NAIRU – were closely intertwined in Friedman’s account of the instability of the price level on either side of the natural rate. But, although endogenous inflation expectations are necessary to produce the vertical long-run Philips curve, the natural rate is not necessary in order to explain how inflationary expectations make the Philips curve unstable.</p>
<p>If Friedman’s Presidential Address was the most important macro-economics paper in the last 50 years, Lucas’s ‘Expectations and the Neutrality of Money’ (1972a) must surely be rated a close second. However, as a theory of what causes business fluctuations or a theory of how monetary policy works, it is seen in retrospect largely as a failure.</p>
<p>Rational expectations is a clever way of proceeding as if this has somehow been accomplished. But the problem then becomes how these expectations are learned and what are the properties of the system that provides the environment in which this learning takes place.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century story of macroeconomics, Keynes, Hicks, Samuelson, Friedman, and Lucas are all examples of men who by force of personal intellect have had a profound influence on the course that economics has taken, If in retrospect we are critical of some of the twists and turns of that course, we have to recognize that their influence has been so great in large part due to the lack of countervailing intellectual force on the opposing side.</p>
