        <p>For our purpose, a very wide definition suggests itself, to wit: a science is any kind of knowledge that has been the object of conscious efforts to improve it. Such efforts produce habits of mind – methods or ‘techniques’ – and a command of facts unearthed by these techniques which are beyond the range of the mental habits and the factual knowledge of everyday life. Hence we may also adopt the practically equivalent definition: a science is any field of knowledge that has developed specialized techniques of fact-finding and of interpretation or inference (analysis). Finally, if we wish to emphasize sociological aspects, we may formulate still another definition, which is also practically equivalent to the other two: a science is any field of knowledge in which there are people, so-called research workers or scientists or scholars, who engage in the task of improving upon the existing stock of facts and methods and who, in the process of doing so, acquire a command of both that differentiates them from the ‘layman’ and eventually also from the mere ‘practitioner.’ Many other definitions would be just as good. Here are two which I add without further explanations: (1) science is refined common sense; (2) science is tooled knowledge.</p>
<p>There is however another and still more compelling reason. The exclusion of any kind of tooled knowledge would amount to declaring our own standards to be absolutely valid for all times and places. But this we cannot do. In practice we have indeed no choice but to interpret and to appraise every piece of tooled knowledge, past as well as present, in the light of our standards, since we have no others. They are the results of a development of more than six centuries, during which the realm of scientifically admissible procedures or techniques has been more and more restricted in the sense that more and more procedures or techniques have been ruled out as inadmissible. We mean this critically restricted realm only when we speak of ‘modern’ or ‘empirical’ or ‘positive’ science. Its rules of procedure differ in different departments of science and, as we have already seen above, are never beyond doubt. Broadly, however, they may be described by two salient characteristics: they reduce the facts we are invited to accept on scientific grounds to the narrower category of ‘facts verifiable by observation or experiment’; and they reduce the range of admissible methods to ‘logical inference from verifiable facts.’ Henceforth we shall put ourselves on this standpoint of empirical science, at least so far as its principles are recognized in economics. But in doing so we must bear this in mind: although we are going to interpret doctrines from this standpoint we do not claim any ‘absolute’ validity for it; and although, reasoning from this standpoint, we may describe any given propositions or methods as invalid – always of course with reference to the historical conditions in which they were formulated – we do not therefore exclude them from the realm of scientific differently, deny to them scientific character – which must be appraised, if at all, according to the ‘professional’ standards of every time and place.</p>
<p>Economic theory does something entirely different. It cannot indeed, any more than can theoretical physics, do without simplifying schemata or models that are intended to portrary certain aspects of reality and take some things for granted in order to establish others according to certain rules of procedure. So far as our present argument is concerned, the things (propositions) that we take for granted may be called indiscriminately either hypotheses or axioms or postulates or assumptions or even principles, and the things (propositions) that we think we have established by admissible procedure are called theorems. Of course a proposition may figure in one argement as a postulate and in another as a theorem. Now, hypotheses of this kind are also suggested by facts – they are framed with an eye to observations made – but in strict logic they are arbitrary creations of the analyst. They differ from the hypotheses of the first kind in that they do not embody final results of research that are supposed to be interesting for their own sake, but are were instruments or tools framed for the purpose of establishing interesting results. Moreover, framing them is no more all the economic theorist does than framing statistical hypotheses is all that the statistical theorist or in fact any theorist does. Just as important is the devising of the other gadgets by which results may be extracted from the hypotheses – all the concepts (such as ‘marginal rate of substitution,’ ‘marginal productivity,’multiplier,’’accelerator’), relations between concpets, and methods of handling these relations, all of which have nothing hypothetical about them. And it is the sum total of such gadgets – inclusive of strategically useful assumptions – which constitutes economic theory. In Mrs. Robinson’s unsurpassably felicitous phrase, economic theory is a box of tools.</p>
<p>For the rest we are particularly interested in logic and psychology. The former claims our attention because economists have made a not inconsiderable contribution to it but especially because of their propensity to dogmatize and to quarrel about ‘method’: economists who enjoy this sport are apt to be influenced by the writings of the logicians of their time which therefore, though more apparently than really, gain some influence, legitimate or otherwise, upon our work. As regards psychology, there is the view that came first to the fore in the eighteenth century, and hence has been sponsored intermittently, that economics like other social sciences deals with human behavior. Psychology is really the basis from which any social science must start and in terms of which all fundamental explanation must run. This view, which has been defended as strongly as it has been attacked, we shall denote by the term Psychologism. Actually, however, economists have never allowed their analysis to be influenced by the professional psychologists of their times, but have always framed for themselves such assumptions about psychical processes as they thought it desirable to make. On the one hand, we shall note this fact occasionally whith surprise because there exist problems in economic analysis that might be attacked with advantage by methods worked out by psychologists. On the other hand, we msut avoid a very natural delusion. If we use an assumption the contents of which seem to belong to a particular field, this does not necessarily mean that we actually invade that field. For instance, the so-called law of decreasing returns from land refers to what might be termed a physical fact. But, as has been pointed out already, this does not mean that in formulating this assumption we are entering the field of physics. Similarly, when I state the assumption that as I go on eating successive pieces of bread my desire for further such pieces decreases, I may be said to be stating a psychic fact. But, in doing so, I am not borrowing anything from professional psychology, good or bad; I am simply formulating what rightly or wrongly I believe to be a fact of common experience. If we place ourselves on this standpoint, we shall find that there is much less of psychology about economic propositions than one might think at first sight. To speak of psychological laws, such as the Keynesian law of the propensity to consume, is a flagrant abuse, because this practice suggest justification for our assumptions, which, in effect, do not exist. Nevertheless, it is necessary to glance ocasionally at the developments in the field of professional psychology, and this necessity arises, though less often, also with respect to a number of other sciences. For the moment, we confine ourselves to mentioning biology as an example. There is, or has been, such a thing as social and economic Darwinism. If we are to appraise this phenomenon, it is just as well to make sure of what Charles Darwin actually said and of the methods and meterials that induced him to say it.</p>
<p>There was no such thing as a New Spirit of Capitalism in the sense that people would have had to acquire a new way of thinking in order to be able to transform a feudal economic world into a wholly different capitalist one. So soon as we realize that pure Feudalism and pure Capitalism are equally unrealistic creations of our own mind, the problem of what it was that turned the one into the other vanishes completely. The society of the feudal ages contained all the germs of the society of the capitalist age. These germs developed by slow degrees, each step teaching its lesson and producing another increment of capitalist methods and of capitalist ‘spirit.’ Similarly, there was no such thing as a New Spirit of Free Inquiry whose emergence would call for explanation. The scholastic science of the Middle Ages contained all the germs of the laical science of the Renaissance. And these germs developed slowly but steadily within the system of scholastic thought so that the laics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries continued rather than destroyed scholastic work. This applies even where it is most persistently denied. </p>
<p>Division of labor itself is attributed to an inborn propensity to truck and its development to the gradual expansion of markets – the extent of the market at any point of time determining how far it can go. It thus appears and grows as an entirely impersonal force, and since it is the great motor of progress, this progress too is depersonalized.</p>
<p>More clearly than did others, Say perceived however that this argument derives from a more general principle that applies also to domestic trade. Under division of labor, the only means normally available to everyone for acquiring the commodities and services he wishes to have is to produce – or to take part in the production of – some equivalent for them. It follows that production increases not only the supply of goods in the markets but normally also the demand for them. In this sense, it is production itself (‘supply’) which creates the ‘fund’ from which flows the demand for its products: products are ‘ultimately’ paid for by products in domestic as well as in foreign trade. In consequence, a (balanced) expansion in all lines of production is a very different thing from a one-sided increase in the output of an individual industry of group of industries. To have seen the theoretical implications of this is one of Say’s chief performances.</p>
<p>The mechanism of pure competition is supposed to function through everybody’s wish to maximize his net advantage (satisfaction or monetary gain) by means of attempts at optimal adaptation of the quantities to be bought and sold. But exclude ‘strategy’ as much as you please, there still remains the fact that this adaptation will produce results that differ according to the range of knowledge, promoptness of decision, and ‘rationality’ of actors, and also according to the expectations they entertain about the future course of prices, not to mention the further fact that their action is subject to additional restrictions that proceed from the situations they have created for themselves by their past decisions. As we shall see below, Walras was very much alive to these difficulties and in places (e.g., in the last paragraph of the 35th lecon of he elements) he clearly saw the necessity looming in the future of constructing dynamic schemata to take account of them. For himself, however, he saw not less clearly that, absorbed in the pioneer task of working out the essentials of the mathematical theory of the economic process, he had no choice but to simplify heroically (elements, p.479). Thus, he postulated (at first) that the quantities of productive services that enter into the unit of every product (coefficients of production) are constant technological data; that there is no such thing as fixed cost; that all the firms in an industry produce the same kind of product, but the same method, in equal quantities; that the productive process takes no time; that problems of location may be neglected. Under such circumstances it was but natural that he used or abused the preogatives of the pioneer still further by narrowing down all the possible types of reaction to a single standard type. For us the question arises: how much of this did he mean to include in his ‘free competition’? It has been held (by Professor Knight among others) that Walras, and the theorists of that epoch generally, intended to make ‘omniscience’ and ideally rational and prompt reaction attributes of pure competition; deviations from this pattern would then find room in the spacious folds of an entity called ‘friction,’ which would thus emerge as a helpmate of pure competition with the aasignment to pick up whatever the latter proved incapable of carrying. It is submitted, however, that there is no point in overloading pure competition like this, and that it is quite possible to separate, in interpreting the writers of that epoch, their concept of pure competition as defined in the preceeding paragraph from any further assumptions that they may have made, in general or for particular purposes, about knowledge, promptness, and rationality of action and all the other things mentioned above, even in those instances in which they did not carry out this separation themselves.</p>
<p>Marshall, however, did not take this line. Just as Walras, more than any other of the leaders, was bent on scraping off everything he did not consider essential to his theoretical schema, so Marshall, following the English tradition, was bent on salvaging every bit of real life he could possibly leave in. As regards the case in hand, we find that he did not attempt to beat out the logic of competition to its thinnest leaf. On the first pages of his Principles he emphasized economic freedom rather than competition and refrained from defining the latter rigorously. Moreover, throughout the Principles, he paid much attention to the problems of individual firms – the manner in which they conquer their Special Markets within which to mneuver, the manner in which they lose them again, and certain consequences that follow therefrom. It is submitted that there is more in this than mere dislike of naked abstractions. There is awareness of that set of problems that later on developed into the theory of monopolistic (Chamberlin) or imperfect (Robinson) competition, whose patron saint Marshall may indeed be said to have been. But there is also a subtle difference in attitude toward these problems between him and the modern exponents of this theory that is not easy to convey.</p>
<p>This relation between the theory of bilateral monopoly or oligopoly to the case of isolated exchange teaches us to see the main problem in the determination of the factors that limit the range of indeterminateness. About this, however, the theory of isolated exchange has really little to say. In all cases of this kind that arise in modern industry, particularly in modern labor markets, determinateness of the ranges between which exchange rates may be expected to fall – sometimes even unique determinateness of individual exchange rates – will depend on the particular circumstances of the case which must be introduced by special assumption. Success will depend on our ability to find hypotheses which, though not of general application, will yet cover a considerable number of cases or describe individual ones of particular importance. But again, as in the case of duopoly and oligopoly, we meet two formidable difficulties: in practice, behavior is shaped, much more than by the observable data of a situation, by expectations that change rapidly in the turmoil of capitalist development; and even if this were not so, behavior could never be fully understood from the objective factors of the given situation without taking account of the kind of people who are in a position to make strategically important decisions and whose numbers are in most cases so small as to make modes unreliable.</p>
<p>But so soon as we project the indifference lines on the commodity plane, the utility dimension vanishes from the picture so that their meaning is no longer dependent on any hypothesis of measurability. They then tell us no more than (1) that the individual considers certain combinations of the two commodities as equally eligible and (2) that he prefers combinations represented by any ‘higher’ indifference curve to combinations represented by any ‘lower’ one. The first man to see the implications of this was Irving Fisher. He had no objection to measurability. On the contrary, he tried to make it operational. But in doing so, he encountered certain difficulties when, in the second Part of his work, he discarded the untenable assumption that utility of each good depends on its own quantity only (‘independent goods’). At this point doubts were bound to arise not only about the measurability but also about its very existence. Accordingly, Fisher presented an analysis completely free from utility assumptions that worked only with indifference maps in the modern sense. With him – as later on with Allen and Hicks – indifference curves were the starting points of the analysis; they were not, as with Edgeworth, derived from a utility surface.</p>
<p>The importance of a dynamic theory. The necessity of developing a dynammic theory rests upon three facts: (1) It is obvious that most quantities demanded and offered, both of finished commodities and of factors of production, as well as prices and incomes are in reality related to other economic quantities that belong not to the same moment but to the past or to the expected future. It is particularly obvious that monopolists want to maximize gains not for the moment but over a stretch of time. (2) It is not so obvious but it is nevertheless true that this makes a great deal of difference to results. If we drop the hypothesis that each element of the economy depends only on the other elements as they are at the same point of time, quite different results and quite new phenomena emerge, for instance the phenomenon of endogenous fluctuations. (3) Finally, the task of developing a dynamic theory is very difficult and cannot be accomplished simply by adding dynamic qualifications to static theory. It requires new techniques and raises fundamental problems of its own. An example of the new techniques required is economic equilibrium, which, if considered from a dynamic standpoint, appears in a new light.</p>
<p>This involves the fundamental principle that construction of the theoretical set-up should precede the statistical work: the relations themselves are not suggested by statistical observations; they are postulates and not results. Sttistical figures are to ‘explain’ the numerical values of some variables by given numerical values of others by the method of multiple correlation – a process which also eliminates those ‘explanatory’ variables whose partial regression coefficients indicate the insignificance of their influence. The system is then, by process of successive substitutions, reduced to ‘final’ equations that are held to depict the economic mechanism. In itself, every step in this procedure is open to serious criticisms, about which no more can be said than that they should not blind us to the greatness of this pioneer effort. </p>
