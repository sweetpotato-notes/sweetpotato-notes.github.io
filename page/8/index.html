        <p>In the closing decades of the twentieth century, China defied the best predictions of development economists and Sinologists alike in compiling a stunning record of economic growth. This was accomplished in the face of formidable obstacles including inefficient state enterprises, ambiguous property rights, irrational prices, primitive transportation, and outmoded banking and securities facilities. </p>
<p>In sum, reforms generated both from above and from below have brought far-reaching, even cataclysmic, changes to the economy, society, politics and culture, changes that touch every citizen and extend to every corner of the land and beyond to redefine China’s place in the world.</p>
<p>It is commonly asserted that, despite far-reaching economic and social reform, China’s political system remains frozen.</p>
<p>Despite significant changes, an apparent disjuncture remains between the free-wheeling economic expansion, on the one hand, and the still highly circumscribed political climate, on the other.</p>
<p>The upsurge in such activities is attributable to several factors attendant upon the reforms: increased population mobility, high levels of surplus labour and unemploymen, growing income disparities, access to previously unavailable economic resources, and declining civic values.</p>
<p>The problem with the diverse theories sketched briefly above is that, while suggestive for analysing the psychological and material roots of protests, resistance, rebellion and revolution, none specifies the threshold point at which popular aspirations and grievances gain sufficient momentum to become politically threatening. Thus, however useful the theories may be in offering explanations for what occurred after the fact, and in drawing attention to areas of conflict and potential resistance, they offer little predictive value.</p>
<p>China’s extensive and deepening integration into the international system in general, and its various commitments to international laws and institutions in particular, have placed leaders under new constraints and provided dissidents with new sources of moral support.</p>
<p>Both liberty and equality are among the primary goals pursued by human beings throughout many centuries; but total liberty for wolves is death to the lambs, total liberty of the powerful, the gifted, is not compatible with the rights to a decent existence of the weak and the less gifted… Equality may demand the restraint of the liberty of those who wish to dominate; liberty - without some modicum of which there is not choice and therefore no possibility of remaining human as we understand the word - may have to be curtailed in order to make room for social welfare, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, to leave room for the liberty of others, to allow justice or fairness to be exercised.</p>
<p>Neo-liberal economists cautioned that an economy based on state ownership of the means of production could not sustain long-term, stable growth. In their view, privatization is a conditio sine qua non for the market economy This premise, enshrined in the ‘Washington Consensus’ became the guiding principle for many of the social engineering programmes of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the former Soviet Union and the East-bloc countries.</p>
<p>Women’s employment must be linked with women’s liberation. Economics is the foundation. Without participation in social production, women would have no economic status. This would in turn undermine the equality between men and women in politics, society and family.</p>

        <p>A study of 2866 farms in seventeen localities and seven provinces in China （1925-1930）</p>
<p>The basis of Chinese agriculture is a farm system of unfenced scattered plots of land for the most part inherited, difficult of management from the farmsteads which are usually located in villages or hamlets of varying size. These villages and hamlets dot the landscape about as thickly as do the solitary farmsteads in the United States, and this signifies a dense population as well as a rural social system entirely different from that in most western countries.</p>
<p>The farm land is generally worked by owners, although approximately one-fifth is farmed by tenants and another one-fifth by part owners, the extent of tenancy varying from almost none to nearly one hundred per cent tenants in some localities. Systems of rent are quite similar to those found in other countries. Rental charges, however, are often not fair either for the tenant or the landlord and on the average rents should be reduced something over one-fifth the present amount.</p>
<p>Not only is the area of land worked by the farmer in China small, but he has also far smaller capital and equipment than the western farmer. In fact, his main investment is labor, but even this is not very great since the Chinese farm averages only two men giving full time to the farm business compared with approximately one and one-half men in the United States. The relatively small amount of labor used on the limited amount of land is partly because the farm business is not sufficiently enlarged by the use of more intensive methods of farming.</p>
<p>The production from the farm business in China and in the United States is remarkably equal in quantity per unit of land, although the method of obtaining these products are entirely different. In the United States the chief means has been the use of capital as well as labor; in China it has been by the use of labor, for the most part human labor, and with very little capital. The resulting production per unit of labor in the United States is apparently at least twenty-five fold greater than in China. Because of the dense population and the high cost of capital, it is evident, therefore, that the great natural resources of China is her man power. What she has to do is to learn how to make the most of this immense resource, because, on the whole, neither human nor animal labor is used to its full capacity.</p>
<p>The remedies for this too small size of farm business are difficult to find. Colonization seems scarcely the solution, since lands for such extensive colonization as would be needed are limited, even in Manchuria and Northwest. Moreover, unless something is done to check the growth of population, colonization will do little permanent good. The same may be said of drawing men from the land to industry. As China becomes modernized, it is inevitable that industries will develop and a certain number of the country people be absorbed into them. Yet it can scarcely be hoped that sufficient numbers of them will be so absorbed as to relieve the present agricultural situation very much. The best future solution of the problem seems to be in some method of population control, and the best immediate solution, more intensive methods of raising crops and the growing of crops that produce more food per unit of land. Such productivity, however, will also be useless if population continues to grow.</p>
<p>The farmer’s life, moreover, needs to be enriched mentally as well as materially. Few of the farmers of China have enough education to enable them to profit from reading, and since three-fourths of the children of farmers are not in school, there seems little chance for immediate improvement in this respect. The farmer cannot be blamed for this directly, since the type of old-fashioned classical school, which has been the only one for him to attend, has not been one to give him any practical help or inspiration. His life seems meagre in recreation, although that he is a social creature is shown by the regular, though small, items expended yearly for tea-drinking with friends, religious cults, and like activities.</p>
<p>China has been a country without reliable statistics, and it is to her advantage to obtain them, not only from the point of view of taking her place in world statistics, but also for the important reason of self-knowledge before there can be self-improvement. This study was begun with the idea of collecting accurate data on Chinese farming conditions to teach to Chinese college students, so that these students might in the future discover for themselves the facts of their own country.</p>

        <p>Instead of making adjustments to the official aggregate data on investment, as other studies have done, we have used the commodity flow method. Estimates have been made for five investment components:<br>1) construction and installation,<br>2) domestic production of machinery and equipment,<br>3) imports of machinery and equipment,<br>4) office furniture and tools,<br>5) and other rural investment.<br>The five components have then been combined to form the estimates of total fixed investment. But in using this method we have been able to cover not only the investment made by the government within the state plan of basic construction but also the investment made by private concerns and households outside the state plan. The commodity flow method has also permitted us to adopt a new valuation basis.<br>The biases in the official valuation stemmed from two main sources: the underpayment of work brigades (draft labor) and the peculiar exchange rates used for computing the official values of imported goods. These biased have been removed in our estimates.</p>
<p>Our estimates generally confirm the government’s claim of investment acceleration in 1952-57. The average annual rate of fixed capital investment, that is, the proportion of GDP devoted to fixed capital formation, was 17.8 per cent in that period. This is remarkably higher than the estimated average rate of 7.5 per cent for 1931-36. If the comparison is made in terms of net capital formation, the difference between the two periods would be even wider. However, the years 1952-57 were followed by a period of tremendous fluctuations in fixed capital investment. Although there are no national income statistics, official or otherwise, which can be used to compute the exact rates of investment, we can say that the rates must have fallen to very low levels in 1961-64.</p>
<p>As in many underdeveloped countries, the speed of capital formation in prewar China was decisively constrained by the low level of voluntary saving in the private sector. In addition to the low level of income, the extremely low life expectancy gave rise to an age structure of the population unfavorable to saving efforts. An extraordinarily large proportion of people were under the working age. Both the birth rate and the infant mortality rate were high, so that a considerable amount of economic surplus in society had to be wasted on raising children who never grew old enough to participate in productive work.</p>
<p>So far as capital formation is concerned, the main change in the 1950’s occurred in the saving mechanism. Instead of relying on voluntary savings, the new government mobilized compulsory savings for the purpose of investment. The traditional constraint on saving was greatly relaxed thereby. In this way, the system of socialist planning can potentially serve as a shortcut to industrialization for underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p> The compulsory savings were realized in two major forms. First, through controls over wages and over prices of consumer goods, and the procurement programs and taxation in the rural areas, the government was able to restrain the consumption level and create budgetary surpluses. Those budgetary surpluses were tailored to, and would be used for, state investment. This is clearly shown by the chief role played by basic construction investment of the government in total capital formation throughout the Communist period.<br>The second form of compulsory saving was the direct use of surplus labor in rural areas for capital construction, such as road building and large water conservation projects. Although labor conscription is not unique in China, the scale which the Peking government used it during 1956-59 was certainly unprecedented. This scale would have been impossible had China not been socialized and the rural population not been regimented.</p>
<p>The steadily rising rate of investment in 1952-56 reflected the changed saving mechanism and the new investment drive of the Communist government; it was not the accidental burst of investment that is occasionally observed in a market economy. China really attempted to cut short the industrilization process by socializing the economy. However, compulsory savings in a socialist country are not without limitation. One of the serious problems is the contradiction between work incentives and a high rate of accumulation. As this study has shown, the economic policy of the Peking government entailed a high marginal propensity to invest. If over a long period most of the fruits of capital formation are devoted to further investment, sparing very little for improving living standards, the working masses might feel disappointed. This in fact was a major issue discussed by economists and planners in China in 1956-57. The consensus was that, while the pre-1956 rate of investment was correct, the rate in 1956 might be regarded as excessive. This review of investment policy led to the moderation in 1957.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the cautious opinions were silenced by Mao Tse-tung, who believes that revolutionary zeal can effectively overcome physical or material constraints. The second Five-Year Plan, carefully formulated by planners and formally approved by the National Congress, was torn up by Mao as sonn as it was made public. In its place came Mao’s Great Leap Forward movement. The fanatic investment and production drives nearly disintegrated the economy. The policy reversal adopted by the new leadership in the early 1960’s was meant to salvage the collapsing economy. One of the most urgent tasks was then to shift the emphasis from investment to consumption, so that work incentives could be restored.</p>
<p>What happened in China during the early 1960’s must be considered abnormal. It is only in very broad terms that one can connect the ups and downs in investment in the Communist era in a ‘functional’ way. That is, in such a political system there is no way to avoid extremist leaders. Consequently, extremist economic policies may occur from time to time, and policy reversals are required (i.e., functionally related) to redress the biases or heal the wounds.</p>
<p>Another crucial question is: What role did capital formation play in China’s economic growth during the Communist period? Interestingly, Western economists have traveled a full circle in their analyses of the function played by investment in an economy. The early Keynesian model, which focused on the problem of short-run stability in an economy, treated investment as a component of effective aggregate demand. This demand component was so volatile in a market economy that its fluctuation tended to cause depressions or inflations if it was not offset by a proper compensatory policy of the government. This view was later modified by E. D. Domar, who emphasized the double role of investment – as a demand component and as a capacity-creating factor on the supply side; from the new thesis came the famous Harrod-Domar model of economic growth. Thereafter, investment became virtually the most important element in all growth models developed by other economist. The importance of investment rested on its capacity-creating nature.</p>
<p>Another sharp turning point in the investment and growth theories came when R. M. Solow bulit his neoclassical model of economic growth. It is called neoclassical model because it assumes that full employment prevails all the time. Hence the function of investment as a demand component is completely ignored. The remaining question is then: How important is the other role played by investment – capacity-creating – in economic growth? According to Solow’s original calculation based on American historical data, the contribution of investment to economic growth was far less important than that of technological advancement. His results showed that 87 per cent of the increase in output per unit of labor input came from technological progresses and only 13 per cent stemmed from the expansion of capital stock.</p>
<p>One criticism of Solow’s initial model was that the measured contribution of technological changes is really a residual which reflects the working of all economic forces other than the inputs of labor and capital. Moreover, the importance of investment is understated because the model assumes that all technological changes have been the disemdodied type. Yet in reality the majority of innovations have to be embodied in new machines and equipment; the gains from those innovations cannot be realized unless firms make investments. This last point led Solow to develop his vintage model of economic growth, in which the embodiment effect of investment is taken into consideration. However, even in the vintage model and many other works which have subsequently appeared to refine Solow’s theory, the contribution of investment to economic growth is still overshadowed by other factors.</p>
<p>In a sense, in economic theory the importance of investment has shifted back from its connection with long-run economic growth to the connection with short-run economic stability. In other words, investment is important primarily because it is such a vital component in aggregate demand. In an affluent society, investment must take place at a high rate if effective demand is to be maintained at full employment. Otherwise a depression would set in.</p>
<p>In China investment has played a more important role than any that has been envisioned by the above models. Its importance, however, does not lie on the demand side. As a rule, there is no worry about demand deficiency in underdeveloped countries, since the propensity to save is low and there are adequate investment outlets. In fact, many of those countries are under constant pressure from inflation simply because domestic aggregate supply falls short of aggregate demand. In the case of Communist China, the situation is further simplified because the government has full control of saving, consumption, and investment.</p>
<p>The crucial role of investment is on the supply side. But even there the Solow model of economic growth does not apply fully. In view of the enormous gap in technology between China and industrially advanced countries, the proportion of technical changes that are of the embodied type must be greater in China than in the United States. Similarly, the quality difference of capital goods between two successive vintage points must be much wider in China than Solow’s model has postulated.</p>
<p>More important is the fact that Solow’s neoclassical assumption of full employment does not hold in China at all. China is perhaps the country with the largest surplus population, that is, persons whose marginal productivity falls below the minimum subsistence cost. In prewar China, capitalist firms hired workers up to the point at which their marginal productivity was equal to the subsistence wage. Thus, the bulk of surplus labor existed in the rural communities, where peasants, whether landowners or tenants, shared their incomes among family members. The situation has not drastically changed in the Communist era, since even state enterprises are unlikely to hire workers at a cost much higher than their contributions to production.</p>
<p>The marginal productivity of surplus labor is so low because the existing stock of capital goods is not sufficient to match the labor force. Only investment can provide extra employment opportunities in the urban areas and absorb unused labor productively in the rural areas. Therefore, in a backward country, both the technological changes and the absorption of surplus labor into production require new investment for embodiment. Where the amount of surplus labor is exceedingly large, as it is in China, the absorption of unused labor outweighs the embodiment of technological changes as the primary source of economic growth. In other words, output is increased at a higher speed by putting the unused labor in production rather than by raising the productivity of those who are already employed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the embodiment of technical changes and the absorption of unused labor. The new machines and production techniques developed by the advanced countries, including the Soviet Union, tend to be labor-saving, because their economies are characterized by labor shortages. Direct borrowing of modern technology from those countries without any adaptation would provide a minimum opportunity for new employment per unit of investment funds. This conflict is clearly demonstrated by the Chinese experience in their First Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>More than 80 per cent of the investment within the state plan in the First Five-Year Plan period went to heavy industry. It is estimated that investment in large plants accounted for over 60 percent of the planned total investment in industry. Ordinarily those large modern plants would require a relatively small amount of labor inputs per unit of fixed capital. In September 1956, when Chou En-lai announced the final version of the First Five-Year Plan, he anticipated that the industrial enterprises newly constructed or reconstructed during 1953-57 would contribute 15 per cent to the gross industrial value product for that period. By the end of 1957, however, it turned out that those new enterprises had actually contributed about 30 per cent to the gross value product. This increase was made possible through some adaptations to intensify the use of labor, such as the larger number of shifts of workers to assure a twenty-four-hour operation of machinery and equipment.</p>
<p>The investment policy adopted by the new leadership during 1961-65 was essentially a middle road, so far as the technological choice is concerned. It attempted to avoid the extreme in either direction. Although emphasis continued to be given to small-scale plants, those units were required to meet certain efficiency standards. Only under these circumstances could capital formation be expected to make its maximum contribution to economic growth.</p>
<p>We may conclude from our study that the Chinese experience has clearly demonstrated both the merits and demerits of the Communist approach to capital formation. On the credit side, a planned economy with all means of production controlled by the government can easily break some of the formidable barriers to economic growth that are generally encountered by underdeveloped countries. On the debit side, such an economy has no automatic mechanism which can effectively prevent economic policy in general and investement policy in particular from going to the extremes. The resulting series of adjustments and counter adjustments are a highly costly process.</p>
