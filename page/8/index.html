        <p>The concept of the real exchange rate is used widely in countries undergoing severe inflation. Within these countries, the business and financial communities follow the movements of the nominal exchange rate as compared with the general price level – usually the consumer price index (CPI). When the exchange rate lags behind the general price level, the real exchange rate is described as falling. When the exchange rate (E) increases faster than does the CPI (Pd) or some other domestic price index, the real exchange rate is described as rising.</p>
<p>A more refined index E(P<em>/Pd) of the real exchange rate corrects for changes in the purchasing power of the dollar by multiplying by a general index (P</em>) of dollar prices in the world market.</p>
<p>In short, the real exchange rate is the real price (i.e., it is being deflated by the country’s own general price index) of the real dollar (i.e., its international purchasing power is held constant over time).</p>
<p>A second way to view the real exchange rate recognizes that in most cases where the real exchange rate must be adjusted, the required adjustment entails changes in the prices of tradable goods relative to those of non-tradables. Under flexible exchange rates, such adjustment ideally occurs by movements of the nominal rate (E), which affects equally the prices of all tradable goods. Under fixed exchange rates, with tradables’ prices given in the world market, adjustment occurs through movements of the internal price level (Pd). In both cases, adjustment occurs through changes in the ratio of tradables prices to non-tradables prices.</p>
<p>A third way to view the real exchange rate examines the forces working on the respective prices of tradable goods and non-tradables. In this view, the nominal exchange rate is the variable bringing about changes in the internal prices of tradables for given levels of their world prices, while the level of wages (W) is the major force causing the internal prices of non-tradables to move relative to those of tradables. Thus, major appreciations (in real terms) of a country’s currency likely entail large gains in the real wages of workers, while important depreciations involve substantial reductions of real wages- at least when one measures these in terms o tradable goods. Viewing E/W as a proxy for the real exchange rate, even though E/W is inexact in the literal sense, contributes greatly to how well we understand both the euphoria sometimes following in the wake of a significant real appreciation of a country’s currency and the pain and suffering accompanying major real devaluations.</p>
<p>A. Forces affecting the supply of foreign currency<br>(1) Improved efficiency in producing export goods<br>(2) Development of new export goods or opening of new supplies of old ones<br>(3) Increases in world prices of export goods<br>(4) Changes in the rate of capital inflow from abroad</p>
<p>B. Forces affecting the demand for foreign currency<br>(1) Reduction (or increase) in intensity of import restrictions<br>(2) Increases in income, part of which is spent on tradable goods<br>(3) Changes in the rate of capital inflow from abroad, part of which usually is spent on tradable goods.<br>(4) Changes in the level of debt service payments<br>(5) Changes in world prices of particular import goods (a rise in world price can affect demand for foreign currency in either direction depending on whether the country has an elastic or inelastic demand for imports of the good in question)</p>
<p>Because these and other forces act together on a country’s real exchange rate – and with an intensity that varies over time – quantitative analysis is quite difficult. In each of the six real cases depicted in figure 1, one particular force seems to predominate. This makes them ideal for expository purposes, but most real-world cases are much more complicated.</p>
<p>Japan has enjoyed a tremendous economic boom, propelled greatly by increasing efficiency in the production of manufactured goods. Because Japan’s efficiency in producing non-tradables dis not increase so quickly, the price level of non-tradables had to rise relative to that of tradables – that is, the real exchange rate had to fall. One can use other views of the real exchange rate to interpret the same phenomenon. On the wage side, increased efficiency caused wages to rise relative to prices of tradables. In terms of demand and supply of foreign currency, Japan’s export growth produced increases in income and in the supply of foreign currency. However, only part of such increases was directly reflected in increased demand for foreign exchange. For supply and demand to be in equilibrium, the real price of foreign currency had to fall.</p>
<p>Turkey exhibits quite different behavior. In the three cases treated so far, the export boom was autonomous. The added supply for foreign exchange drove down the real exchange rate in Japan and Ecuador, while it permitted major increases in imports plus accumulation of foreign exchange at the old real exchange rate in Iraq. By contrast, Turkey’s export boom was induced. The moving force was a massive liberalization of pre-existing import restrictions dating from the first quarter of 1980. The liberalization increased the demand for imports. This in turn caused the real exchange rate to rise and so stimulated an increase in the volume of exports. In this case, the view that the real exchange rate is the price level of tradable goods relative to that of nontradables is one that falters. Internal relative prices fall for goods being freed from restrictions. Through the effect of liberalization in increasing the real exchange rate, this fall is accompanied by a rise in the relative prices of the remaining tradable goods such as the exports depicted in figure 1.</p>
<p>The Jamaican case quite naturally leads to others that shared a similar experience. Consider the cases of Chile (1969-1972), Ghana (1979-1982), Uganda (1973-1978), and Zaire (1974-1978). In each of these cases, a massive fiscal deficit set in motion the machinery of monetary expansion. This produced pressure on the country’s international reserves. Each country resorted to a series of import restrictions rather than allowing a sufficient rise in the nominal exchange rate to stem the incipient drain of reserves These import restrictions in turn permitted the internal price level to rise dramatically relative to the exchange rate. Thus, the great appreciation of the exchange rate increasingly distorted the structure of internal prices and subjected the economy to progressively more serious strains In each case, the dam finally broke, as a massive devaluation reversed the downward trend of the real exchange rate.</p>
<p>All of the cases just examined reflect situations in which the drastic decline of the real exchange rate was in some sense a byproduct both of a fiscal deficit out of control and of the monetary expansion that such a deficit engendered. In these cases, the real exchange rate movement was not a conscious policy objective, nor was it the natural result of an inflationary fiscal deficit. In these instances, the deterioration of the real exchange rate could have been prevented by a policy of moving the nominal exchange rate upward so as to reflect the full extent of the inflationary forces being generated internally. The governments in question failed to take this route. Inevitably, import restrictions piled up and grossly distorted relative prices.</p>
<p>In a sense, then, one could say that Japan’s real exchange rate appreciation was a natural consequence of the process of technical advance that it was experiencing. Ecuador’s real exchange rate appreciation was a natural outgrowth of the development of oil exports plus the oil price boom, and Uruguay’s was the natural concomitant of an increased inflow of foreign capital. Similarly, Turkey’s real exchange rate depreciation was the natural result of its massive liberalization of import restriction in 1979.</p>
<p>The real exchange rate always has been an important economic concept. However, during the 1970s and 1980s, international inflation, oil crises, massive capital movements, and debt crises have drawn increased attention to its importantce. Because the forces affecting real exchange rate movements vary in intensity over time, quantitative analysis of these forces is quite difficult. However, in each of the countries selected for analysis here, one particular force seems to predominate – making these countries ideal for expository purposes.</p>
