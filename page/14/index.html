        <p>In (Schumpeter 1911) according to Schumpeter’s innovative theoretical approach entrepreneurs are the systematic social force that drives the economy, even the political economy, out of general market equilibrium. Since this force is responsible for the historical mission – and thus legitimization – of capitalism, namely to increase labour productivity of societies, it is at least as important as the countervailing market forces that drag the economy back to equilibrium. With this idea the capitalist system suddenly appeared as an oscillating system governed by two opposing forces. But not only were these forces opposing, they also were different kinds of forces.</p>
<p>Market forces actually were just institutionalized rules of (usually different) market mechanisms enforced by a larger political unit, the capitalist state. The ‘entrepreneur’ was a subset of the set of firm owners, namely those who were able to introduce innovations. Though Schumpeter still has single human individuals in his mind when he writes about ‘the entrepreneur’, he nevertheless treats them like a class when it comes to the description of social dynamics. Like Karl Marx, who (in the second preface to ‘Das Kapital’, [Marx 1964 (1857)]) disentangles ‘the capitalist’ as a character mask from its human individual carrier, Schumpeter actually uses his concept of ‘the entrepreneur’ to describe an algorithm that a subset of the set of firm owners performs. In this context the individual physical person is of no importance, Schumpeter just enhances class analysis of the capitlist class!</p>
<p>The first set of questions concerned innovation itself. How does it work? It becomes necessary to distinguish between invention, which is the job of the researcher/scientist, and innovation, which is a second stage of activity that glues together existing, previously invented ‘old elements’ to form a ‘new combination’ that then is put to the test in a broader social environment. In this respect Schumpeter’s theoretical innovation certainly has provoked an extremely fruitful development of a scientific community studying the emergence and distribution of knowledge that only blossomed decades after his death.</p>
<p>A second set of questions concerned the swarming of innovations. Why do innovations occur in the form of a pulsation and not as a smooth and continuous flow? This question forced economists to take a closer look at the historically observed reasons for the sawrming processes. Collective experiences, communication processes and expectation formation became a scientific focus. Schumpeter himself proposed to link the different frequencies of innovative swarming to different types of causes. For high frequency cycles (named Kitchin cycles) the achievement of desired inventory levels might be important. For medium frequency cycles (named Juglar cycles) it might be that the characteristic time necessary to transfer capital from one branch of activity to a new, extra-profit promising branch is responsible. And for the long cycle (called Kondratieff cycle) a special type of innovation, namely basic innovations (e.g. steam power, electricity …) that only occur about every half centuries are responsible. Needless to say that all these suggested fields of investigation are at the core of today’s most relevant economic research.</p>
<p>Third, with innovation being closely linked to the finance needed to develop and to test new products and processes in a market environment – and eventually to fail – a theory of finance came into focus. Is there a positive correlation between size of firms, their financial possibilities, and thus in the end their innovative power? This type of questions leads to the study of oligopolization and further on to the role of independent financial intermediaries that are detached from innovative firms. The current global crisis has at its root the mismatch between global welfare gains (achieved by innovations and redistribution of wealth and income) and the profit rates promised by Wall Street investment bankers. The topic launched by Schumpeter never was more acute than today.</p>
<p>But these first amendments to Keynesianism were just some baby steps for the mathematician Richard Goodwin. He felt that the simple linear models based on Keynes’ accounting framework and some crude assumptions on the constancy of socio-psychological propensities (to consume, to invest, etc.) were leading to linear first-order difference equations that only could describe much too simple dynamics, and thus were inadequate. The mathematics used by the first generation of Keynesians rather resembled what Newton had used for physics 200 years ago; this language was way too primitive for a complicated object of investigation like human society. Typically such models, e.g. Hick’s business cycle model, had to use exogenously assumed barriers to be able to describe cyclical movements. One of Richard Goodwin’s next goals was to overcome this deficiency in mathematical elegance. And as for many trained mathematicians aesthetics and elegance played an important role for Goodwin.</p>
