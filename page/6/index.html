        <p>The two well-known approaches to business cycles, the New Classical and the New Keynesian approaches, both model expansions and contractions as being due to exogenous factors, although the New Keynesian approach does show that an underemployment equilibrium can occur through optimizing choices, which makes the underemployment equilibrium or the recession to be caused by endogenous factors. However, the expansion is usually caused by exogenous factors, such as an increase in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>The case for studying business cycles that are endogenously generated has been eloquently made by Geoffrey Moore (1977, p.97), an authority on business cycles: ‘accidents’ like a big strike, a new discovery, an oil embargo, a very poor (or a very good) harvest, or a declaration of war or peace can precipitate both upturns and downturns; and that long-term growth affects the entire cycle.</p>
<p>Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occuring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic; in duration business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years; they are not divisible into shorter cycles of similar character with amplitudes approximating their own. (Burns and Micchell, 1946)</p>
<p>General equilibrium is a good description of market exchange when endowments are given and trade occurs only after a vector of equilibrium prices has been found. Is it possible that when trade (a) is in produced goods and not initial endowments, and (b) occurs in ‘disequilibrium’, or before an equilibrium vector of prices is found, the sort of cycles described in the Burns-Mitchell definiion cannot be avoided?</p>
<p>For twentieth-century cycles, especially those observed in market economies after World War II, the most striking stylized facts about business cycles are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fluctuating growth of output is accompanied by a procyclical inflation rate and an inverse relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate; that is, the inflation rate is anticyclical with the unemployment rate.</li>
<li>The comovement of price inflation with wage inflation, with the latter usually leading the former except during periods of very rapid inflation.</li>
<li>Procyclical real wages indicating that the wage share out of national income is also procyclical. Consequently, at cyclical peaks the profit share, defined as one minus the wage share, is generally low.</li>
<li>A long-term positive trend rate of growth trough of real GNP or GDP. This implies each subsequent cyclical trough of GNP (GDP) does not cancel out the ‘gains’ made by the previous cyclical peak. This has led to the growing acceptance of the Schumpeterian view that growth and cycle are inextricably interwined, and that the cycle is growth and cycle are inextricably interwined, and that the cycle is a necessary condition for growth and vice versa. This view is also associated with Harrod (1936) and Goodwin (1982).</li>
<li>Recurrent but nonperiodic cycles. This suggests that although we can compute the average duration of  large number of cycles, as done by researchers at the NBER, no two cycles ever appear to be of equal duration. Consequently, turning points cannot be predicted.</li>
<li>A procyclical relationship between labor productivity and output. (Incidentally, this rules out the standard neoclassical aggregate production function, with a declinig marginal product of labor, as part of a business cycle theory.)</li>
<li>The general procyclical nature of profits. In particular, before sales decline, profits per unit of sales decline.</li>
<li>Procyclical nature of investment in fixed capital and inventories. Although this is well established for the typical cycle, there are individual components that either lead or lag behind in the cycle.</li>
<li>Procyclical expansion of credit and monetary aggregates. During contractions, both narrowly and broadly defined monetary aggregates show reduced growth rates, but not absolute declines. This implies that the income velocity of money is also procyclical.</li>
<li>The synchronization of international cycles, a tendency that may well intensify in the future. Institutional changes such as free capital mobility, floating exchange rates, and the increase in international arbitrage and speculative activities have increased interdependence among the major capitalist nations, which is likely to lead to a further synchronization of cycles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cycles that are recurrent but nonperiodic make decisions risky and creat an exposure to unemployment and bankruptcy (Gordon, 1986). Workers cannot predict when layoff may eliminate the extra income needed to meet some debt obligation (for a mortgage or a consumer durable). Similarly, firms cannot predict whether an expansion to a plant undertaken now will be justified through increased slaes due to general prosperity or whether the increased sales will fail to materialize due to the onset of a recession. If a recession does occur, the carrying costs of the expanded plant may exceed the marginal increase in sales revenue. Furthermore, firms cannot shift to other activities because the recession typically affects many economic activities, as the Burns-Mitchell definition makes clear.</p>
<p>As noted above, the truth content of many physical theories is often confirmed through experimentation. The truth content of ‘grand theories’ is much more difficult to establish. Newtonian physics ‘worked’ perfectly well to a first approximation, until generalized by Einstein, when Newtonian physics became a special case of Einstein’s more general theory. In economics, grand theories such as the Walrasian general equilibrium theory or the labor theory of value are themselves mental constructs whose truth content cannot be confirmed in any meaningful sense. The Walrasian model is the model of an auction; the actual economy does not behave like an auction, although auctions do take place in the economy. The value of general equilibrium theory is that of a counterfactual: if an economy were perfectly competitive, with no frictions, and there were complete markets for all contingencies, then all prices would reflect true opportunity costs, etc. It is no more than a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Similarly the labor theory of value is a ‘grand theory’ that is a counterfactual thought experiment: if all goods were produced with other produced goods and labor, then the prices of all goods would reflect their direct and indirect labor content.</p>
<p>Of course, a number of econometricians (e.g. Leamer, 1983; Hendry and Ericsson, 1991; Pagan, 1987) are deeply concerned about the abuse of econometrics. Hendry and Ericsson (1991) in particular have articulated a rigorous econometric methodology that pays a great deal of attention to specification testing. They have set down a set of six criteria that must be satisfied in order that a model may capture the salient features of the data and deliver reliable inferences on economic issues; it may however, take a while before that method is adopted by applied econometricians.</p>
<p>These three important conceptual innovations in Friedman’s work served as the basis for future analysis, carried out by the New Classical school:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ‘representative’ agent approach, which stands for aggregates</li>
<li>The emphasis on ‘anticipations’ in Friedman</li>
<li>The use of Walrasian general equilibrium</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize the model, the mechanism generating cycles is as follows: exogenous demand shocks transmit imperfect price signals to firms; the firms are handicapped in not having any information except on their own local markets. The exogenous demand shock leads to an increase in price, which leads to an increase in output – that is, the cyclical component Yc. The lower the general price variability, the greater the Yc. In this model the source of the demand shock does not exist. However Lucas (1977; 1981a) identifies the source as being increases in the money supply. If the price level is determined by the quantity theory, then increases in money supply must lead to increases in the price level, where firms, who have no information except prices in their own markets, misread a general price level increase as an increase in their own relative price. Without this misperception, there would be no increase in output, no cyclical component. But this misperception occurs even though all agents, including firms, are supposed to have rational expectations.</p>
<p>As stated earlier the RBC model was an attempt to produce a business cycle theory that was compatible with a Walrasian competitive intertemporal general equilibrium, but without the assumption of asymmetric information or misperceptions, an approach that was a contradiction of rational expectations and the existence of complete contingent Arrow-Debreu markets. It also took the lessons of the Lucas critique (1976) as its point of departure. The essential elements of the RBC model are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimizing behavior on the part of the representative consumer and producer/seller; in particular, as all agents are intertemporally rational, they substitute consumption and labor intertemporally in response to technology shocks;</li>
<li>Exogenous random shock parameters in the aggregate as well as other inter-industry production functions, that generate data that looks like actual business cycle data;</li>
<li>The assumption of extensive contingent markets and complete market clearance at every time period;</li>
<li>The assumption of rational expectations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In views of (3) and (4) above, all nonconvexities such as market failures or imperfections are ruled out. Therefore, the model being ‘too good to be true’ (Tobin), the only way that fluctuations can be introduced in such a model is by way of exogenous, unexplained shocks. Tobin had offered the unexpected shock route as a reductio ad absurdum, which, to everyone’s surprise, suddenly became ‘the theory’, the theory of real business cycles.</p>
<p>The use of a representative consumer and a representative firm is valid if and only if both preferences and production are quasi homothetic (see Blackorby and Schworm, 1988). Intuitively, this means that the Engel curve (and the expansion path) must be a straight line, but it need not pass through the origin. In their applied work, the real business cycle theorists use Cobb-Douglas utility and produciton functions. The use of Cobb-Douglas is sufficient (but not necessary) for aggregation. Geweke (1985) has argued persuasively that in avoiding the Lucus critique but using models with aggregate data, it is implicitly assumed that the aggregator function is structural with respect to policy intervention, whereas aggregator functions are ‘no more struatural than are within regime, reduced form relations’. Geweke also gives examples that show it matters a great deal which representative agent is used, even when aggregation is exact, and that aggregators are not the same for production, factor demand, and supply – i.e., the familiar cross-equation restrictions of neoclassical production fail. Geweke’s numerical examples show that the aggregation errors are of the same order of magnitude as those that arise from ignoring expectations, emphasized in the Lucus critique.</p>
<p>RBC theory was an attempt to remedy the defects of the New Classical business cycle theory of Lucas and Barro, which relied on misperceptions or informational asymmetries that were incompatible with rational expectations. The Lucas and Barro models were not in fact ‘equilibrium’ accounts of the business cycle. In contrast, RBC is indeed an equilibrium account, provided output can be decomposed into a permanent and a cyclical component. The cyclical component is then expressed as a sum of exogenous random shocks, which can be done only by arbitrarily imposing a particular lag structure on the exogenous technology shock parameter. The particular lag structure is not determined endogenously in the model. In effect the cyclical component differs hardly at all from that of the Lucas model.</p>
<p>In general, we know that in the special case of a linear dynamical system that is made up of say a trend and two cyclical components, in which each motion is independent of the other, we can get the total response of the system by simply adding the separate components. Conversely, we can decompose the observed behavior of such a system into distinct parts and observe the separate influences. However in a nonlinear system, such decomposition is not possible, or any attempted decomposition will be arbitrary.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of linear and nonlinear dynammic systems suggests that perhaps economic time series are strongly nonlinear, a conclusion that Goodwin (1953) came to early in his studies in business cycle theory. To quote Goodwin (1953, 1982, p.117): There is no such thing as a trend factor that continues to rise right through the depression. Conversely, the cycle would be quite different were it not for these special relations which give rise to the trend. Therefore we cannot separate out trend and cycle and discuss each independently.</p>
<p>In New Classical models the large share of state expenditure in the total composition of GNP is ignored. Indeed, the state itself is viewed either as a major source of macro disturbances (Friedman) or at least as being irrelevant and ineffective. The ineffectiveness of the state is formalized in an array of ineffectiveness and neutrality propositions (Sargent, 1987). In addition, New Classical theory revived the classical proposition that a laissez-faire economy would settle at the ‘natural’ or full-employment level of output, unaided – i.e. that the market mechanism was self-equilibrating. This is the exact opposite of the central result of the General Theory of Keynes, which demonstrated the the ‘natural’ level of output in modern capitalism was an underemployment equilibrium, and that full employment is a special case. Thus Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the slump is the general case, and that since World War II prosperity has been achieved by growth in aggregate effective demand usually, but not exclusively, stimulated directly or indirectly through an activist monetary and fiscal policy.</p>
<p>It is this last-mentioned Keynesian proposition that has been formalized by the New Keynesian business cycle theory. The proposition bears repeating: The normal and general condition for capitalism is an underemployment equilibrium, a slump! An expansion requires intervention!</p>
<p>It was mentioned that Keynes identified the sudden collapse of the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital (MEC) as the main cause of the business cycle. The MEC is at first shifting to the right, calling forth more investment. But when it reverses direction and begins to shift to the left, this reversal is a nonlinearity. Although this is an early and crude form of nonlinearity, which is exogenously imposed, with its ‘ultimate’ explanation relegated to the psychology of entrepreneurs, in the New Keynesian school nonlinearities in the form of wage and price rigidities arise endogenously as a consequence of either strict optimizing behavior, or near-optimal behavior, given the structural characteristics of the economy.</p>
<p>In the New Classical models, the particular structural characteristics of an economy are ignored. In a first approximation, this technique is always legitimate, but bringing theory closer to reality requires a reduction in the level of abstraction, just as the physics of Einstein reduced the level of abstraction implicit in the physics of Newton. New Keynesians, using the same techniques as the New Classical economists, reduce the level of abstraction by taking account of particular characteristics of modern economies. In this sense the New Keynesian theory is a better approximation than the New Classical approach. It goes without saying that ‘better’ does not mean that the theory cannot be improved further.</p>
