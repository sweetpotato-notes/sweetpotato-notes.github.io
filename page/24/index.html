        <p>The transformation of the economy of the People’s Republic of China from a planned to a more market-oriented economy is one of the most significant developments in the world history during the last quarter of the 20th century.</p>
<p>A market economy differs from a centrally planned one in three important ways.<br>Major economic resources are privately owned rather than owned by the state.<br>Prices are determined by the market forces of demand and supply rather than by administrative orders.<br>Economic decisions concerning consumption, production, distribution, and investment are decentralized, being made by private citizens or individual enterprises rather than by central command.</p>
<p>A major objective of central procurement of agricultural products was to provide adequate supplies of essential food products to the urban residents under a system of rationing; among items rationed were food grain, vegetable oil, meat, sugar, and cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Since enterprises obtained their inputs through central allotment, surrended their outputs for central distribution, and had no control over their profits, they did not respond to prices. The main concern of enterprise managers was to obtain through skillful negotiations more than sufficient material and labor inputs to fulfill the production targets. They tended to understate the productive capacity of their enterprise in order to reduce output targets, and to overstate the input requirements in order to ensure their fulfillment. Inefficiencies and wastes occurred under this system, as partly reflected in the underutilization of prodcutive capacity and the large stockpiling of inventories in Chinese state enterprises (Zhou, 1982).</p>
<p>This ‘responsibility system’ is similar to private farming in a market economy, with each farm household leasing its land and paying the delivery quota as rent.</p>
<p>The major elements of the industrial reforms include<br>(i) a certain autonomy regarding the use of retained profits, production planning, sales of output, experimentation with new products, and capital expansion;<br>(ii) adoption of features of an ‘economic responsibility system’ by assignment of identifiable tasks to lower level units and payment to them according to productivity;<br>(iii) increase in the role of markets<br>(iv) the streamlining of the administrative system at local levels for enterprises under local control;<br>(v) the encouragement of the establishment of collectively owned enterprises.</p>
<p>Reform in the industrial sector has turned out to be more difficult than in the agricultural sector. It is much easier to make small farm householders behave like private enterprises in a market economy than to make large state enterprises so behave for four types of reasons.<br>First, ideologically, members of the Communist Party of China believe in the ownership and the control of the means of production by the state. They are unwilling to surrender control of large state enterprises to nongovernment individuals and allow them to keep substanial profits for themselves, as in the case of small farms.<br>Second, politically, government bureaucrats are unwilling to give up their power and vested interests by allowing the state enterprises to operate independently. Economic ministries tend to hold on to their control over the operations of the state enterprises. The bureau of material supplies tends to retain its control over the distribution of major material inputs.<br>Third, economically, large industrial enterprises are more dependent on factors outside their control than are the small household farms. Given a piece of land, a farm household can produce as it pleases, subject to climate conditions. A large industrial enterprise needs the supplies of equipment and of material inputs produced by other enterprises. The entire system of pricing and distribution of industrial products and material inputs has to be changed to provide more autonomy to the state enterprises.<br>Fourth, administratively, the efficient operation of a large industrial enterprise is much more difficult than operation of a small farm. Chinese managers often do not have sufficient knowledge and experience to run a modern enterprise as an independent entity. Even with additional training, managers and administrators of state enterprises are reluctant to give up their old habits of dependence on the economic ministries.<br>The mode of operation of a large economic organiation is difficult to change, as it is true for a large American corporation and more so for a large country like China.</p>
<p>Seven key elements of the Decision of 20 Oct 1984 concerning reform of the economic system are to<br>(i) give individual state enterprises autonomy in decisions regarding production, supply, marketing, pricing, investment, and personnel as independent profit-seeking economic units;<br>(ii) reduce the scope of central planning and, except for certain major products, change the method from mandatory planning to guidance planning;<br>(iii) allow prices of more products to be determined by the forces of demand and supply rather than by central control;<br>(iv) develop macroeconomic control mechanisms through the use of taxes, interest rates, and monetary policy under an improved financial and banking system;<br>(v) establish various forms of economic responsibility systems within individual enterprises to promote efficiency and encourage differential wage rates to compensate for different kinds of work and levels of productivity;<br>(vi) foster the development of individual and collective enterprises as supplements to the state enterprises;<br>(vii) expand foreign trade and investment as well as technological exchanges.<br>An often-quoted slogan to capture the essential characteristics of the reform is, ‘Invigorate the microeconomic units. Control by macroeconomic means.’</p>
<p>Reform toward a more market-oriented economy will continue in China. The degree of success may be uncertain, but there is no turning back to a system of central control in agriculture and in industry operating within closed doors. Substantial economic growth will continue even if structural reforms progress slowly. The Chinese economy was able to grow between 1952 to 1979 in spite of the adverse conditions of inefficient central planning and two very serious political disturbances. It can only be expected to grow faster under the more favorable economic and political conditions of the 1980s.</p>
<p>The first common feature in the growth process of both parts of China is the reduction of govenment intervention and the encouragement of private initiative.<br>Economic liberalization took place in Taiwan through government encouragement of private investment in the form of providing financial services of government banks, the establishment of a stock market, tax exemptions for certain industries, relaxing controls over the establishment of factories, and appropriately adjusting the prices of government-produced commodites and services.</p>
<p>The second common element is the important of the agricultural sector in the early stage of the growth process.<br>In both Taiwan and the Mainland, the  increase in agricultural productivity was achieved mainly by redistributing land to the farmers.</p>
<p>A third common feature is the promotion of exports as an important component of the development strategy.</p>
<p>The fourth element is the government’s emphasis on the stability of the general price level. The governments of both regions learned from the bitter experience of hyperinflation is China prior to the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, as inflation was recognized to be an important factor contributing to the collapse of the government of the Republic of China in the Mainland.<br>Two-digit inflation in the Mainland took place in 1988 because of the failure of the government to control the supply of money and credits, but price stability was restored by early 1990 mainly by contractionary monetary policy.</p>
<p>The fifth common element is the gradual decontrol of restrictions on imports and the setting of an official exchange rate close to the free market level.</p>
<p>Together with the rapid growth of the economy in the Mainland since 1977 was a transformation of the economy to a mostly private economy in the sense that by 1990 a large fraction of the national output was produced by profit-seeking individuals and enterprises whose incentives are similar to those prevailing in a market economy.</p>
<p>During that meeting, and a five-day meeting to follow in Beijing in June 1986 involving three other outside economists, John Fei of Yale, Anthony Koo of Michigan State and Lawrence Lau of Stanford, the author found the reform officials to be extremely open-minded. Any suggestions could be brought up for discussion. Important considerations are political feasibility and reaction of the population. Ideology becomes an issue only to the extent that Communist Party members and govenment officials with given ideological background needed to understand and be presuaded of the proposal if it is to be put into practice. Other than that I did not experience any more ideological constraints in our discussion and recommendations than in the discussion with economic officials in Taiwan in the 1960s to the 1980s when the same group of economists were advising them.</p>
<p>Concerning housing reform, it was recognized that housing should be ‘commercialized’ in the terminology of the Chinese government. By the ‘commercialization’ of housing, it meant making housing service a commodity subject to the law of demand and supply. One important consideration in housing reform is how to compensate the urban residents who, for several decades, have been accustomed to government subsidized housing. An obvious proposal is to increase urban wage to compensate for the increased cost of rent under a free market for housing. This creates the need to increase prices of products due to the increase in wage cost, which might argue that the effect would be a one-time increase in prices and not an inflationary process. The perception of the population concerning the inflationary process and the redistributional effects of increased rental with wage subsidies were important issues of discussion.</p>
<p>By Chinese official statistics, which follow the statistical system of the former Soviet Union, national output is divided into the five sectors of agriculture, industry, construction, transportation and commerce. In 1978 when reform began, there five sectors accounted respectively for 32.8, 49.4, 4.2, 3.9, and 9.8 percent of national income.<br>Of the total labor force of 401.5 million in 1978, 306.4 million or 76.3 percent were laborers in rural areas while 95.0 million were classified as staff and the remaining 20.5 million worked in collective enterprises in cities and towns.<br>In 1978, 77.6 percent of the gross output value of industry was from state enterprises.</p>
<p>Turning to the demand side, consumer demand in urban areas was controlled by the government in three essential aspects.<br>First, housing of staff and workers was assigned by the unit in which they worked, with negligible rent. There was no market for urban housing.<br>Second, important food items including grain, meat and oil were rationed at below market prices.<br>Third, the purchasing power of the urban consumer was controlled by controlling wage rates.</p>
<p>Two characteristics of the political environment deserve to be noted: The stability of political institutions and the large amount of popular support for economic reform.</p>
<p>Although Deng, Zhao and other leaders were confident of the general direction of reform towards a more market-oriented economy, in the sense of reducing central control and providing economic reward to individuals and economic units willing to produce more, they were not sure of exactly what economic institutions to establish. The procedure followed was one of experimentation. A favorite saying was ‘touching the rocks as you cross the river,’ deciding on the next step only after you have completed the previous step.</p>
<p>While it was easy to adopt the responsibility system in small state enterprises, the system was not easy, and in the early stage of reform not intended, for large enterprises.</p>
<p>Controlling the prices of certain government-distributed products while allowing them to be set in free markets led to a two-tier price system. The welfare effect of such a system was debated by economists. While admitting the virtue of free market prices, some critized the simultaneously existing controlled prices. When the government was the purchaser of certain products at below market prices, the seller essentially paid a tax to the government. If the quantity of government pruchases was fixed, it amounted to a lump sum tax which does not have adverse incentive effects. When the government was the seller of certain products at below market prices, as in the case of material inputs to state enterprises, the purchaser received a subsidy. If the quantity can be increased by negotiation, the purchaser would have an incentive to resell the extra quantities in the free market to make a profit. State enterprises receiving supplies from the government at below market prices dis resell some of the in markets; they also had a competitive edge over other enterprises not receiving the subsidy. Overall, it appeared that the ill-effects from subsidies might be outweighted by the positive effects of making the products available in free markets to benefit the consumers or producers. The Oct 1984 Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party singled out price reform as one of its important components. The decontrol and resetting of prices have continued until today.</p>
<p>As the sixth step in the reform process, China expaned foreign trade and encouraged foreign investment in an open-door policy.<br>Foreign trade and investments have performed three significant functions in China’s economic development.<br>First, foreign investment augments domestic investment in the process of capital accumulation while foreign trade expands China’s prodution possibility frontier inclusive of trade.<br>Second, foreign investment and trade are channels through which updated technology and management practices are introduced into China in the process of learning by doing.<br>Third, and not the least, joint ventures, foreign enterprises, and foreign trade provide competition to Chinese state and collective enterprises, forcing them to be more efficient and at the same time putting pressure on the Chinese price system to reflect the forces of demand and supply.</p>
<p>In Oct 1992, some fourteen years after the official begining of economic reform introduced by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party in 1978, the Congress of the Communist Party was able to adopt a resolution moved by Deng Xiaoping to declare that China’s national output was produced by profit-seeking economic units. In 1992, real national income increased by 12 percent by official statistics,, with most observers projecting a 10-year growth rate averaging 7 to 9 percent. Private enterprises were flourishing. China had already become essentially a market economy.</p>
<p>While meeting with Secretary-General Zhao on Thursday, November 3, 1988, I discussed the possibility of having more political freedom, including freedom of speech, of publication and of assembly, and the possibility of promoting the respect for law in China. The Secretary-General believes that China can make progress towards having more political freedom and respect for the law, but the process, as I see it, is probably going to be slow given China’s historical and political background. After the meeting, it become clear to me that if Mainland China practiced political freedom and the respect for the law, which is being practiced in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong people would increase their confidence in the government of the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Concerning foreign investment, I wrote in Princeton Alumni Weekly (Sept. 1989) that ‘New Foreign investment has slackened not because of morality, but because investors are recalculating their risks. As long as investors believe that investment in China will be profitable and not unduly risky, they will continue to invest.’ This applies especially to the people in Hong Kong and Taiwan, even though they had much stronger emotional reaction to Tiananmen Square than others. Economic dependence on China is stronger in these two lands than elsewhere. Using low-cost labor in China, manufactures in Hong Kong and Taiwan can compete effectively in the world market, so their entrepreneurs have powerful incentives to maintain their manufacturing facilities in China and to establish new ones. Investment and trade from other Asian nations, including Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, have been affected only slightly by the unrest.</p>
<p>Inflation means rapid increase in the general price level. The price level can be measured by a price index which is an average of the prices of many commodities at a given time, as compared with similar average at a base period. Two commonly used general price indices in the United States are the consumer price index (CPI) and the Gross National Product (GNP) deflator. The former is the average price of a standard bundle of consumer goods used by a typical household. It measures how the monetary cost of living of such households changes. The latter is an average of the prices of all commodities (including producer goods as well as consumer goods) and services that are produced by an economy in a given period. Its increase provides a broader definition of inflation than the increase in the CPI.</p>
<p>Since price is an exchange rate between units of money and units of a physical commodity or a service, prices would rise if there are more units of money chasing after (offered to buy) the same quantites of physical commodities and services.</p>
<p>Most economists agree that without going through the increase in money supply the other causes cannot generate inflation.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1988 when inflation became serious, the government tried to restrict the increase in money and credit by assiging credit quotas to banks in different regions and provinces. In addition interest rates on bank deposits were raised to attract deposits and to reduce the quantity of money in circulation, thus making the price level lower than otherwise. Although administrative means such as the assignment of credit quotas to banks were employed because of the absence of a modern banking system for monetary control by economic means, the Chinese officials did use some economic tools such as raising interest rates to control inflation.</p>
<p>In summary, historical records on the policies to deal with inflation in 1985, 1988 and 1993 show that the Chinese government was able to control inflation each time. The question is, will the Chinese government continue to do so in the future, at least in the remaining years of the 1990s. My answer is a qualified yes, subject to some uncertainty.</p>
<p>We understand that monetary stimulation can be successful only if applied occasionally and under the environment of a stable price level. As Milton Friedman has put the point aptly by an analogy. Increasing money supply to an economy is like feeding alcoholic drinks to a person. A small quantity used when the economy or the person is in a normal and stable condition does sometimes help to stimulate, but continued usage of a large quantity will lead to malfunctioning and collapse. I hope that most Chinese government officials appreciate this point. </p>
<p>One element that affects the quality of some Chinese economic statistics from the viewpoint of the user is the incomplete description of the method of construction. Examples are price indexes and indexes of national income in constant prices of selected years. Documentation and description of sources and methods of construction for national income data are much less detailed than can be found in the statistical appendixes of the ‘National Income’ issues of the Survey of Current Business. The poor standard of documentation is one aspect of the underdeveloped state of statistical work in China. In addition, detailed documentation of certain statistical series may reveal information regarded as confidential by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Therefore, in computing national output in 1952 prices, the relative weight given to industrial output compared with agricultural output is about three times the relative weight applied when 1980 prices are used. Chow (1985) estimated the annual growth rate of industry to be about 11% and that of agriculture and other sectors to be about 1.9%, using official data. A large weight given to industry can produce a high rate of growth of 6.0% per year. By using 1980 prices and thus giving a small weight to industrial output, one would obtain an average rate of growth in real national income between 1952 and 1980 of 3.9% per year iinstead of 6.0%. The 3.9% growth rate is more meaningful because the high prices assigned to industrial products in 1952 are arbitrary and because the growth of future real output will be measured by using prices close to 1980 prices. It is interesting to note that, according to the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States (1979), Gross National Product of the People’s Republic of China was estimated to be $99 billion in 1952 and $444 billion in 1978, implying an annual growth rate of 5.94%.</p>
<p>(Houthakker) The elasticity for food with respect to total expenditure might be higher for the countries and time periods with lower total expenditure, though the evidence is equivocal.</p>
<p>A major landmark of economic reform was the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist party of China on Reform of the Economic Structure of Oct 20, 1984. The decision includes the following major components concerning the operation of the domestic economy.<br>First, we should extend the decision-making power of enterprises owned by the whole people… on the premise of following the state plans and subjecting itself to state control, the enterprise has the power to adopt flexible and diversified forms of operation; plans its production, supply and marketing; keep and budget funds it is entitled to retain; appoint, remove, employ or elect its own personnel according to its relevant regulations; decide on how to recruit and use its work force, ad on wages and rewards; set the prices of its products within the limits prescribed by the state; and so on. In short, the enterprise should be truly made a relatively independent economic entity and … responsible for its own profit ad loss and … act as a legal person with certain rights and duties.<br>Second, concerning central planning, the ‘socialist state institutions must manage, inspect, guide and regulate the activities of the enterprises, as is necessary, through planning and by economic, administrative and legal means; … it must designate, appoint and remove the principle leading members of the enterprises or approve their appointment and election … for a considerably long time to come, our national economic plans on the whole can only be rough and elastic and … we can do no more than, by striking an overall balance in planninng and through regulation by economic means, exercise effective control over major issues while allowing flexibility on minor ones … the socialist planned economy is a planned commodity economy based on public ownership, in which the law of value must be consciously followed and applied. ‘<br>Third, concerning price reform, ‘The irrational system of pricing is closely related to the irrational system of price control. In readjusting prices, we must reform the over-centralized system of price control, gradually reducing the scope of uniform prices set by the state and appropriately enlarging the scope of floating prices within certain limits and of free prices. Thus prices will respond rather quickly to changes in labor productivity and the relation between market supply and demand …’ However, market price determination was somewhat restricted. ‘All enterprises should achieve better economic results through efforts to improve management and operation and should never try to increase their income by price increases. It is absolutely impermissible for any unit or person to boost prices at a general rise in prices, disrupt the socialist market and harm the interests of the states and the consumers.’ The Decision also allowed the market sector of collective and individual enterprises to expand. Wage rates were to be differentiated enough ‘to apply fully the principle of rewarding the diligent and good, punishing the lazy and bad, and of giving more pay for more work and less pay for less work …’</p>
<p>A slogan used by Chiese reform officials since 1985 was ‘Invigorate the microeconomic units and control by macroeconomic means.’ This is another way of describing the policy stated in the Decision of Oct 1984 to change from compulsory planning to guidance planning: ‘A planned economy does not necessarily mean the predominance of mandatory planning, both mandatory and guidance planning being its specific forms … guidance plans are fulfilled mainly by use of economic levers; mandatory plans have to be implemented, but even then the law of value must be observed.’</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the present Chinese economic system, with proper management, is capable of achieving a fairly high level of performance to generate a reasonably rapid rate of economic development. This conclusion is based on the following three propositions, each to be discussed in turn.<br>Proposition 1.<br>A decentralized socialist market economy, of properly designed, can perform somewhat between 60 and 100 percent as efficiently as a capitalist market economy. By ‘60 percent efficiency’ is meant producing 60 percent of the output using the same amount of resources.</p>
<p>Proposition 2.<br>The combination of economic planning with market socialism or capitalism can make the economic system work about as well, if not better, than pure market socialism or capitalism.</p>
<p>Proposition 3.<br>Monopolistic and rent-seeking behavior on the part of state enterprise managers and government bureaucrats in China affects the distribution of income but might not seriously affect the efficient working of the market.</p>
<p>The fact that the Chinese economy has grown substantially in the last decade is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that it will grow at similar rates in the next two decades. Some reservations have been voiced.<br>First, the economic momentum generated by the reform will run out of steam. In particular, reform in agriculture increased efficiency in terms of rasing output per capita as compared with farming under Commune system, but once the level of output per capita is raised, no further increase is expected. In fact, the record of agricultural output since 1985 has ben poor. This is a valid point, except that the energy of the farmers unleashed by the present system (in spite of the uncertainty about the right of long-term land use) has been applied to work in light industry, and in commercial and other more productive pursuits in the rural areas, and that the process of technological change in the form of the changing occupation and production mix in China’s countryside has continued and is expected to continue, thus helping to raise output per capita in rural areas.<br>Second, inexperienced macroeconomic management in an environment of imperfect macroeconomic institutions may destroy the economic fabric for further growth. This is a serious possibility. Like other observers, I am concerned about the current inflation, but it is my judgement that the Chinese government will succeed in preventing it from getting out of hand, even if some arbitrary controls might be applied and the progress of price reform might be slower than in the absence of inflation. Like many economists who appreciate the distinction between the flexibility of relative prices and the control of the (average) price index, I believe that it is possible for the Chinese government to control inflation whlie allowing prices of individual products to remain fairly free.<br>One well-known experience is the control of the inflation in Taiwan in the 1950s, when aggregate demand for consumer goods and the velocity of currency circulation were reduced significantly by raising the rates of interest, following advice given by Sho-chieh Tsiang to the Taiwan government.<br>High interest rates as recommended above, in order to be effective, have to be accompanied by stopping the rapid increase in money supply.<br>Third, some observers are concerned that the reform process will stop. As I have argued above, reasonable economic progress in China can occur without significant further reforms in economic institutions. The present system is good enough, although it can be better under Chinese socialism as put forward by the October 1984 Decision. Supporting this argument further is the open-door policy, which will continue to provide energy to China’s economic growth of foreign in the form of capital and technology import, and of setting examples for and providing competition to Chinese State enterprises. The contribution to economic growth of foreign investment, and of collective and private enterprises, has been evident in the province of Guangdong, neighboring Hong Kong.</p>
<p>China may be slow in correcting the present deficiencies of the economic system. These deficiencies include the dependency of labor on the iron rice bowl, the dependency of state enterprises on the government for financial help, a certain amount of corruption, the lack of proficiency in economic planning and macroeconomic management, and the poor environment for foreign investment.</p>
<p>It is my conclusion that market socialism combined with a certain degree of central planning will succeed in modernizing China. This conclusion does not rule out the possibility that capitalism may be better than socialism under other circumstances. Most people living in a capitalist society prefer capitalism as a form of economic organization. China has a very different historical experience from the United States. How feasible and desirable capitalism is under China’s political and economic situation are difficult questions to answer. Many Chinese leaders believe that socialism is more desirable for China, although many young people in China are questioning this view. Since the end of the Second World War, under the leadership of the United States and Soviet Union, capitalist and communist countries have been engaged in a cold war. People and intellectuals on each side have criticized the other system while arguing the superiority of their own. The Chinese economic experiment, by combining socialism with market incentives, may help resolve the conflict in economic ideas and hasten the end of the Cold War. </p>
<p>The hypothesis of asset management:<br>A person managing an asset will, to the best of his or her knowledge, try to derive the most benefit from it, in (a) utilizing its services directly himself or herself, (b) allowing others to use its services, or (c) delivering it to others.</p>
<p>Law of supply of asset service<br>When the marginal benefit from providing the service of an asset is smaller (larger), the asset manager will supply less (more) of its service.</p>
<p>Law of asset delivery<br>When the marginal benefit from delivery or surrending an asset to others is smaller (larger), the asset manager will be less (more) willing to deliver it, possibly reducing the qualities of delivery in the form of delays or lower product quality.</p>
<p>Law of asset maintenance<br>When the benefit of managing an asset, either through the use of its service or through surrending it to others, is smaller (larger), the manager will be less (more) willing to maintain it or to improve upon it.</p>
<p>Law of rent seeking<br>When opportunities to extract payment or benefit from providing the service of an asset or from delivering it to others are available and not unduly risky, the manager will take advantage of them.</p>
<p>First, financial items are not included in the objective function so that there is no reason to economize on the use of inputs. Second, insofar as an increase of output is desirable and can be achieved by an increase of the use of inputs, there is an incentive for the manager to negotiate for more material and other inputs, hence the soft-budget constraint.</p>
<p>The differences in behavior between model A under central planning and model B prevailing after urban economic reforms in 1980s are that in the latter case there is a tendency to maximize profits by increasing management effort, and that there is a tendency to economize on the use of material inputs because profits enter the objective function of the manager. Note, however, that these tendencies are weak if the relative elasticity parameter θ is large, reflecting the unimportance of marginal profits in the manager’s utility function. This is the case for large and medium-size state enterprises, as compared with small state enterprises. In large state enterprises, marginal profits yield only small benefits to the manager, after an allowable amount of profit has been used for distribution as bonuses to management, staff and workers, both in cash and in the form of consumer durables. By contrast, the high profit incentive for the owner-manager of a private enterprise in a market economy is captured in model B, with θ set equal to zero. The appropriate link between marginal profts and the manager’s marginal benefits remains a serious problem in enterprise reform in China.</p>
<p>If one accepts the empirical finding of no technological change in China from 1952 to 1980, one may try to explain why it happened. It is an accepted fact that the Chinese economic planners tried to introduce industrial technology and the method of planning from the Soviet Union in the 1950s and began the First Five-Year Plan in 1953. The Chinese planners also tried to increase output by investing a large fraction of national output in industry, especially heavy industry. This paper has described the increases in outputs in five sectors and in total through capital formation in these sectors by using sectorial and aggregate production functions. These is no reason to assume that technological progress occurred during the period up to 1980. Economic cooperation with the Soviet Union ended in the 1960s. Without incentives from private enterprises to innovate, where could technological progress have come? I have found no theory to support the assertion that central planning will produce technological progress. It might happen, as suggested by Young [1992] for the case of Singapore, that much government direction in industrial investment does not lead to an increase in total factor productivity. Although technological progress defined in the context of Solow’s [1956] growth model is an important phenomenon to explain for a market economy like the United States, one cannot presume its existence in a country like China during a period when private initiatives for innovations or adopting new technology from abroad appeared to be absent. For such an economy one does not need to find explanations for the varying rates of productivity changes as Romer [1987] attempted to do for the United States. However, after the reforms in the 1980s when profit-seeking enterprises began to grow, the study of technological progress in China is an important and interesting topic for further research.</p>
