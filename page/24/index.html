        <p>The two well-known approaches to business cycles, the New Classical and the New Keynesian approaches, both model expansions and contractions as being due to exogenous factors, although the New Keynesian approach does show that an underemployment equilibrium can occur through optimizing choices, which makes the underemployment equilibrium or the recession to be caused by endogenous factors. However, the expansion is usually caused by exogenous factors, such as an increase in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>The case for studying business cycles that are endogenously generated has been eloquently made by Geoffrey Moore (1977, p.97), an authority on business cycles: ‘accidents’ like a big strike, a new discovery, an oil embargo, a very poor (or a very good) harvest, or a declaration of war or peace can precipitate both upturns and downturns; and that long-term growth affects the entire cycle.</p>
<p>Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occuring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic; in duration business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years; they are not divisible into shorter cycles of similar character with amplitudes approximating their own. (Burns and Micchell, 1946)</p>
<p>General equilibrium is a good description of market exchange when endowments are given and trade occurs only after a vector of equilibrium prices has been found. Is it possible that when trade (a) is in produced goods and not initial endowments, and (b) occurs in ‘disequilibrium’, or before an equilibrium vector of prices is found, the sort of cycles described in the Burns-Mitchell definiion cannot be avoided?</p>
<p>For twentieth-century cycles, especially those observed in market economies after World War II, the most striking stylized facts about business cycles are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fluctuating growth of output is accompanied by a procyclical inflation rate and an inverse relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate; that is, the inflation rate is anticyclical with the unemployment rate.</li>
<li>The comovement of price inflation with wage inflation, with the latter usually leading the former except during periods of very rapid inflation.</li>
<li>Procyclical real wages indicating that the wage share out of national income is also procyclical. Consequently, at cyclical peaks the profit share, defined as one minus the wage share, is generally low.</li>
<li>A long-term positive trend rate of growth trough of real GNP or GDP. This implies each subsequent cyclical trough of GNP (GDP) does not cancel out the ‘gains’ made by the previous cyclical peak. This has led to the growing acceptance of the Schumpeterian view that growth and cycle are inextricably interwined, and that the cycle is growth and cycle are inextricably interwined, and that the cycle is a necessary condition for growth and vice versa. This view is also associated with Harrod (1936) and Goodwin (1982).</li>
<li>Recurrent but nonperiodic cycles. This suggests that although we can compute the average duration of  large number of cycles, as done by researchers at the NBER, no two cycles ever appear to be of equal duration. Consequently, turning points cannot be predicted.</li>
<li>A procyclical relationship between labor productivity and output. (Incidentally, this rules out the standard neoclassical aggregate production function, with a declinig marginal product of labor, as part of a business cycle theory.)</li>
<li>The general procyclical nature of profits. In particular, before sales decline, profits per unit of sales decline.</li>
<li>Procyclical nature of investment in fixed capital and inventories. Although this is well established for the typical cycle, there are individual components that either lead or lag behind in the cycle.</li>
<li>Procyclical expansion of credit and monetary aggregates. During contractions, both narrowly and broadly defined monetary aggregates show reduced growth rates, but not absolute declines. This implies that the income velocity of money is also procyclical.</li>
<li>The synchronization of international cycles, a tendency that may well intensify in the future. Institutional changes such as free capital mobility, floating exchange rates, and the increase in international arbitrage and speculative activities have increased interdependence among the major capitalist nations, which is likely to lead to a further synchronization of cycles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cycles that are recurrent but nonperiodic make decisions risky and creat an exposure to unemployment and bankruptcy (Gordon, 1986). Workers cannot predict when layoff may eliminate the extra income needed to meet some debt obligation (for a mortgage or a consumer durable). Similarly, firms cannot predict whether an expansion to a plant undertaken now will be justified through increased slaes due to general prosperity or whether the increased sales will fail to materialize due to the onset of a recession. If a recession does occur, the carrying costs of the expanded plant may exceed the marginal increase in sales revenue. Furthermore, firms cannot shift to other activities because the recession typically affects many economic activities, as the Burns-Mitchell definition makes clear.</p>
<p>As noted above, the truth content of many physical theories is often confirmed through experimentation. The truth content of ‘grand theories’ is much more difficult to establish. Newtonian physics ‘worked’ perfectly well to a first approximation, until generalized by Einstein, when Newtonian physics became a special case of Einstein’s more general theory. In economics, grand theories such as the Walrasian general equilibrium theory or the labor theory of value are themselves mental constructs whose truth content cannot be confirmed in any meaningful sense. The Walrasian model is the model of an auction; the actual economy does not behave like an auction, although auctions do take place in the economy. The value of general equilibrium theory is that of a counterfactual: if an economy were perfectly competitive, with no frictions, and there were complete markets for all contingencies, then all prices would reflect true opportunity costs, etc. It is no more than a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Similarly the labor theory of value is a ‘grand theory’ that is a counterfactual thought experiment: if all goods were produced with other produced goods and labor, then the prices of all goods would reflect their direct and indirect labor content.</p>
<p>Of course, a number of econometricians (e.g. Leamer, 1983; Hendry and Ericsson, 1991; Pagan, 1987) are deeply concerned about the abuse of econometrics. Hendry and Ericsson (1991) in particular have articulated a rigorous econometric methodology that pays a great deal of attention to specification testing. They have set down a set of six criteria that must be satisfied in order that a model may capture the salient features of the data and deliver reliable inferences on economic issues; it may however, take a while before that method is adopted by applied econometricians.</p>
<p>These three important conceptual innovations in Friedman’s work served as the basis for future analysis, carried out by the New Classical school:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ‘representative’ agent approach, which stands for aggregates</li>
<li>The emphasis on ‘anticipations’ in Friedman</li>
<li>The use of Walrasian general equilibrium</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize the model, the mechanism generating cycles is as follows: exogenous demand shocks transmit imperfect price signals to firms; the firms are handicapped in not having any information except on their own local markets. The exogenous demand shock leads to an increase in price, which leads to an increase in output – that is, the cyclical component Yc. The lower the general price variability, the greater the Yc. In this model the source of the demand shock does not exist. However Lucas (1977; 1981a) identifies the source as being increases in the money supply. If the price level is determined by the quantity theory, then increases in money supply must lead to increases in the price level, where firms, who have no information except prices in their own markets, misread a general price level increase as an increase in their own relative price. Without this misperception, there would be no increase in output, no cyclical component. But this misperception occurs even though all agents, including firms, are supposed to have rational expectations.</p>
<p>As stated earlier the RBC model was an attempt to produce a business cycle theory that was compatible with a Walrasian competitive intertemporal general equilibrium, but without the assumption of asymmetric information or misperceptions, an approach that was a contradiction of rational expectations and the existence of complete contingent Arrow-Debreu markets. It also took the lessons of the Lucas critique (1976) as its point of departure. The essential elements of the RBC model are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimizing behavior on the part of the representative consumer and producer/seller; in particular, as all agents are intertemporally rational, they substitute consumption and labor intertemporally in response to technology shocks;</li>
<li>Exogenous random shock parameters in the aggregate as well as other inter-industry production functions, that generate data that looks like actual business cycle data;</li>
<li>The assumption of extensive contingent markets and complete market clearance at every time period;</li>
<li>The assumption of rational expectations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In views of (3) and (4) above, all nonconvexities such as market failures or imperfections are ruled out. Therefore, the model being ‘too good to be true’ (Tobin), the only way that fluctuations can be introduced in such a model is by way of exogenous, unexplained shocks. Tobin had offered the unexpected shock route as a reductio ad absurdum, which, to everyone’s surprise, suddenly became ‘the theory’, the theory of real business cycles.</p>
<p>The use of a representative consumer and a representative firm is valid if and only if both preferences and production are quasi homothetic (see Blackorby and Schworm, 1988). Intuitively, this means that the Engel curve (and the expansion path) must be a straight line, but it need not pass through the origin. In their applied work, the real business cycle theorists use Cobb-Douglas utility and produciton functions. The use of Cobb-Douglas is sufficient (but not necessary) for aggregation. Geweke (1985) has argued persuasively that in avoiding the Lucus critique but using models with aggregate data, it is implicitly assumed that the aggregator function is structural with respect to policy intervention, whereas aggregator functions are ‘no more struatural than are within regime, reduced form relations’. Geweke also gives examples that show it matters a great deal which representative agent is used, even when aggregation is exact, and that aggregators are not the same for production, factor demand, and supply – i.e., the familiar cross-equation restrictions of neoclassical production fail. Geweke’s numerical examples show that the aggregation errors are of the same order of magnitude as those that arise from ignoring expectations, emphasized in the Lucus critique.</p>
<p>RBC theory was an attempt to remedy the defects of the New Classical business cycle theory of Lucas and Barro, which relied on misperceptions or informational asymmetries that were incompatible with rational expectations. The Lucas and Barro models were not in fact ‘equilibrium’ accounts of the business cycle. In contrast, RBC is indeed an equilibrium account, provided output can be decomposed into a permanent and a cyclical component. The cyclical component is then expressed as a sum of exogenous random shocks, which can be done only by arbitrarily imposing a particular lag structure on the exogenous technology shock parameter. The particular lag structure is not determined endogenously in the model. In effect the cyclical component differs hardly at all from that of the Lucas model.</p>
<p>In general, we know that in the special case of a linear dynamical system that is made up of say a trend and two cyclical components, in which each motion is independent of the other, we can get the total response of the system by simply adding the separate components. Conversely, we can decompose the observed behavior of such a system into distinct parts and observe the separate influences. However in a nonlinear system, such decomposition is not possible, or any attempted decomposition will be arbitrary.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of linear and nonlinear dynammic systems suggests that perhaps economic time series are strongly nonlinear, a conclusion that Goodwin (1953) came to early in his studies in business cycle theory. To quote Goodwin (1953, 1982, p.117): There is no such thing as a trend factor that continues to rise right through the depression. Conversely, the cycle would be quite different were it not for these special relations which give rise to the trend. Therefore we cannot separate out trend and cycle and discuss each independently.</p>
<p>In New Classical models the large share of state expenditure in the total composition of GNP is ignored. Indeed, the state itself is viewed either as a major source of macro disturbances (Friedman) or at least as being irrelevant and ineffective. The ineffectiveness of the state is formalized in an array of ineffectiveness and neutrality propositions (Sargent, 1987). In addition, New Classical theory revived the classical proposition that a laissez-faire economy would settle at the ‘natural’ or full-employment level of output, unaided – i.e. that the market mechanism was self-equilibrating. This is the exact opposite of the central result of the General Theory of Keynes, which demonstrated the the ‘natural’ level of output in modern capitalism was an underemployment equilibrium, and that full employment is a special case. Thus Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the slump is the general case, and that since World War II prosperity has been achieved by growth in aggregate effective demand usually, but not exclusively, stimulated directly or indirectly through an activist monetary and fiscal policy.</p>
<p>It is this last-mentioned Keynesian proposition that has been formalized by the New Keynesian business cycle theory. The proposition bears repeating: The normal and general condition for capitalism is an underemployment equilibrium, a slump! An expansion requires intervention!</p>
<p>It was mentioned that Keynes identified the sudden collapse of the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital (MEC) as the main cause of the business cycle. The MEC is at first shifting to the right, calling forth more investment. But when it reverses direction and begins to shift to the left, this reversal is a nonlinearity. Although this is an early and crude form of nonlinearity, which is exogenously imposed, with its ‘ultimate’ explanation relegated to the psychology of entrepreneurs, in the New Keynesian school nonlinearities in the form of wage and price rigidities arise endogenously as a consequence of either strict optimizing behavior, or near-optimal behavior, given the structural characteristics of the economy.</p>
<p>In the New Classical models, the particular structural characteristics of an economy are ignored. In a first approximation, this technique is always legitimate, but bringing theory closer to reality requires a reduction in the level of abstraction, just as the physics of Einstein reduced the level of abstraction implicit in the physics of Newton. New Keynesians, using the same techniques as the New Classical economists, reduce the level of abstraction by taking account of particular characteristics of modern economies. In this sense the New Keynesian theory is a better approximation than the New Classical approach. It goes without saying that ‘better’ does not mean that the theory cannot be improved further.</p>
<p>The standard competitive model is based on the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>All buying and selling decisions are static and independent of time.</li>
<li>There is full and symmetric information among buyers and sellers about the price and quality of the goods in question</li>
<li>The transactions costs are zero, so that no one has to make markets for the buying and selling of goods</li>
<li>Goods are allocated to the highest bidders, through fully flexible prices, that instantaneously reflect changes in supply or demand</li>
<li>The ceteris paribus separation of the demand schedule and the supply schedule as conceptually distinct entities is valid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although market structure is usually studied by experts in industrial organization, Hall (1986) investigated market structure through time series variation in individual industries associated with the aggregate business cycle. Specifically, he investigated whether there was evidence of market power, indicating departures from competitive model. For with market power, there is no longer a presumption of full and efficient utilization of resources.</p>
<p>In order to determine the nature and extend of market power, Hall focuses on two issues crucial to market strcuture: the divergence (over the cycle) between price and marginal cost in some fifty U.S. industries, and whether the market power translates into excess profits. But actual data do not show excess profits, only normal rates of return. Could it be that excess profits are somehow dissipated? If so, how are they dissipated? Hall proposes some hypotheses, which will be considered in some detail next.</p>
<p>The evidence on market power suggests the possibility that U.S. industry must make excess or pure profits, although actual and reported business profits represent no more than a reasonable return on capital. Hall indeed finds evidence of pure profits – typically of the order of 20 percent per dollar of sales. The pure profit should in theory encourage entry that would drive prices down and eliminate pure profits. But entry does not take place mainly because minimum threshold scales of plants are large and the existing firms in the industries have excess capacity, implying that firms are operating on the decreasing portion of their average cost curves. The excess capacity implies that firms have a significant amount of fixed costs. Potential entrants into the industry foresee that they cannot cover the fixed costs at a price that would result from competition between the existing firms in the industry and the new entrants. The pure profits of the existing firms are dissipated in the large fixed costs and in advertising costs that are necessary to maintain product differentiation. Thus market power does not lead to entry as fixed costs serve as barriers to entry, and the fixed costs themselves absorb a good part of latent monopoly profit. The result is that actual profits are not very high.</p>
<p>Finally, what lessons can be drawn for macroeconomics from the above analysis? First, productivity is procyclical, which suggests there must be a significant amount of labor hoarding, as small fluctuations in employment produce large fluctuations in output. A competitive firm is unlikely to let its work force remain idle; it can sell additional output without depressing the price. Unless the price is so low that it cannot cover the cost of materials, the firm can make added profit by putting all of its workers to work. But a firm with market power may well hoard labor and not expand output in a temporary downturn, because the additional output may not increase profit at all as the decline in price may fully offset the increase in sales volume.</p>
<p>Second, Hall’s finding of excess capacity suggests that it is physically possible for aggregate supply to be highly elastic. Thus firms are capable of increasing their output above their normal level by hiring only a little additional new labor. And since price far exceeds marginal cost, the increment to GNP (GDP) from the added output will be worth more than the added cost. Thus output in such an economy is constrained by demand; a major war, or a prolonged monetary stimulus can draw forth huge increases in GNP (GDP). But a prolonged monetary or fiscal stimulus will also lead to even more capacity being added. This is because high demand that is expected to be long-lasting raises expected profits in the existing market niches, and also makes new niches sufficiently profitable for exploitation. In the long run the expected pure profit will be zero, but with a higher total capacity.</p>
<p>Third, industries with excess capacity and market power have no incentive to expand output to full employment; such firms will set prices to maximize profit, but they will pick a price where profit is locally unaffected by small changes in price. That is, the curve showing profit as a function of price is flat at its maximum. Consequently, within some region the firm cannot improve its profit by a significant amount even if the cost of changing the price and moving to a higher output is small. Thus the firm keeps its price at the previous level even though new conditions justify a different level of output.</p>
<p>Fourth, in a competitive model, marginal cost rises with output. In such a model a profit maximizing level of output is well defined. But when an equilibrium of output is along a flat portion of the marginal cost curve, then we may either view it as multiple equilibria or think of it as indeterminate. With indeterminacy, the firm perceives itself as capturing a fixed amount of profit no matter what its price and output are. Thus with flat marginal costs, adjusting price and output decisions are not a matter of priority for management. Other areas of management, such as better products, more effective advertising, and reductions in overhead and production costs receive higher priority.</p>
<p>Hall’s analysis is free of transcendental and nonverifiable expressions; its elegance lies in the sparse theoretical structure with which he is able to show empirically that the product market in the United States is far from the competitive ideal; it is in fact characterized by monopolistic competition, a finding that must influence the formulation of New Keynesian business cycle theory.</p>
<p>New Keynesians accept Keynes’s key message in the General Theory, that the normal condition for capitalism is an underemployment equilibrium, and that an expansion requires intervention. However, the underemployment equilibrium can be seen to be a logical consequence of the actions of rational agents.</p>
<p>The representative agent framework identifies micro level rigidities as being responsible for the failure of the economy to adjust to changing conditions. More recent work suggests that the representative agent framework leads to a fallacy of composition: asymmetric adjustment costs at the firm level do not imply asymmetric response at the aggregate level, and price rigidities due to menu costs or near-rational behavior at the firm level do not imply rigidities at the aggregate level. Thus micro level rigidities are neither necessary nor sufficient for aggregate level rigidities.</p>
<p>Le Corbeiller (1933) argued that it was by chance that the theory of oscillations was developed by ‘telephone engineers’ but the theorems were quite independent of their specific applications in mechanics, thermodynamics, or economics. He made a strong plea for a marriage of political economy and the new theory of oscillations in explaining fluctuations in prices as well as the business cycle.</p>
<p>He also made a very important distinction between a forced oscillation and a self-sustained oscillation. A forced osciallation has an unchangeable periodic cause, such as variations due to seasonal factors for example. However, self-sustained oscillation is governed by nonlinear controls and a mechanism that has inertia, viscosity and rigidity. These complications are as inevitable in political economy as they are in radio-engineering. A self-sustained oscillation acts as if the inertia, viscosity, and rigidity can be overcome by a compensating nonlinear mechanism. An important characteristic of relaxation oscillations is the presence of one nonlinearity per period, which ensures that turning points occur.</p>
<p>Hick’s (1950) business cycle model is a linear multiplier-accelerator model that is made nonlinear by two exogenously imposed nonlinearities, the ceiling and the floor. The Van der Pol equation shows that one endogenous nonlinearity is both necessary and sufficient to ensure that turning points occur.</p>
<p>The Benassy (1986) model is an important representative of the work of economists who call themselves ‘neo-Keynesians’. The neo-Keynesians represent an approach that rejects the market clearance assumption of the New Classical school, but they accept that important macro questions should be investigated from a microeconomics perspective. Consequently, their analysis begins with a representative agent. Like the New Keynesians, the neo-Keynesians assume a representative household and a representative firm. However, they claim to be ‘non-Walrasian’ in the sense that they reject the mythical auctioneer. Without an auctioneer, it is necessary to face the problem of who sets the price. The non-Walrasian apprach is thus open to different market structures. While a detailed exposition of the non-Walrasian approach is outside the scope of this book, the first section below provides a brief introduction. It also contains an informal statement of the Benassy business cycle model. In section 10.2 the model is formally stated, and it is shown that for the purposes of cycles the model can be reduced to the Lienard-Van der Pol equation, so that Theorem 8.3.2 can be applied, and it is shown that the requirements of the theorem are satisfied. It is also shown that the reformulation as a Lienard equation has advantages over the original formulation, particularly when it comes to interpreting the mathematics in terms of economics. It also helps to bring out the elegance of the model in that no special functional forms need to be assumed. It also highlights the particular market interactions that are proposed to be central in the business cycle.</p>
<p>Goodwin (1967) identifies the dynamics of the labor market as the governing mechanism behind the business cycle. While most economists deal with total output only, Goodwin focuse on its dual, namely value added. Since net output is also equal to value added, the two main divisions of value added are wages and profits (assuming all interest can be lumped in with profits). That is, national income is divided into the share of wages, and the share of profits. The share of wages depends on the phase in the business cycle. In the expansion phase, the share of wages rises both through rising wages and rising employment. The higher this share, the lower the profit share. But the profit share is the main determinant of gross investment, and employment growth depneds on it. Hence the lower the profit share, the slower the growth of employment, so that the ratio of people employed in the labor force (i.e., the employment ratio) falls. New job creation falls as investment falls, and the labor force grows through natural increase and through workers displaced by labor saving technical innovations. The growth in the unemployed puts downward pressure on wages. As wage growth falls, profits rise. This spurs investment and employment growth. In the neighborhood of full employment, wage increases put downward pressure on profits, so that at the peak of the cycle profits per unit of sales decline. The decline in profits then leads to a downturn. The cycle is repeated.</p>
<p>Throughtout the cycle, wages and income grow; in the downturn, income falls but usually not to the same level in real terms as the previous trough in income. In this way we see cyclical fluctuations around the post factum growth trend, although the growth trend does not exist independently of the cycle. As is shown below, a number of comovements can be shown to exist, especially when the model is extended to include money.</p>
<p>The Goodwin model explicityly puts the issue of income distribution at the center of the explanation of the business cycle. Countries that have tried some form of cooperative agreement on wage increases have fared better in controlling the cycle. The Japanese economy, too, has weathered many a cycle in spite of its heavy reliance on exports by achieving fairly smooth growth in comparison to the U.S. economy. I believe they have achieved it with a greater degree of agreement on wage growth, and with lower interest rates. Lower interest rates are feasible if inflation is low. In other words, such countries have some form of a tacit incomes policy. An income policy may be the answer to reducing the ravages of business cycles and the consequent stop-go policies that accompany it. But that is not the subject of this book.</p>
