        <p>Econometrics is concerned with the estimation of relationships among observable (and sometimes even unobservable) variables. Any relationship to be estimated is almost always assumed to be stochastic. However, the relationship is often specified in such a way that it can be decomposed into a deterministic and a stochastic part. The deterministic part is often represented as a known algebraic function of observable variables and unknown parameters.</p>
<p>An example of eq. (1.2) is the double-logarithmic functional form in which g(y) = In y and f( Xi) = In Xi. It has the constant-elasticity property with the advantage that the parameters are independent of the units of measurement. </p>
<p>However, linear functions, while they may approximate whatever underlying function reasonably well for small changes in the independent variables, frequently do not work very well for many others purposes. For example, as a production function, it implies perfect substitution among the different inputs and cons&amp;~ marginal products. It cannot represent the phenomenon of diminishing marginal returns. Moreover, the perfect substitution property of the linear production function has the unacceptable implication that almost always only a single input will be employed and an ever so slight change in the relative prices of inputs will cause a complete shift from one input to another. </p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the Cobb-Douglas production function was discovered not from a priori reasoning but through a process of induction from the empirical data. Cobb and Douglas observed that labor’s share of national income had been approximately constant over time and independent of the relative prices of capital and labor.</p>
<p>The C.E.S. production function was discovered, again through a process of induction, when the estimated u from eq. (1.6) turned out to be different from one as one would have expected if the production function were actually of the Cobb-Douglas form. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, although the C.E.S. production function is more general than the Cobb-Douglas production function (which is itself a limiting case of the C.E.S. production function), and is perfectly adequate in the two-input case, its generalizations to the three or more-input case impose unreasonably severe restrictions on the substitution possibilities. [See, for example, Uzawa (1962) and McFadden (1963)]. In the meantime, interest in gross output technologies distinguishing such additional inputs as energy and raw materials continued to grow. Almost simultaneously advances in the computing technology lifted any constraint on the number of parameters that could reasonably be estimated. This led to the growth of the so-called “flexible” functional forms, including the generalized Leontief functional form introduced by Diewert (1971) and the transcendental logarithmic functional form introduced by Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau (1973). These functional forms share the common characteristics of linearityin-parameters and the ability of providing second-order approximations to any arbitrary function. In essence they allow, in addition to the usual linear terms, as in eqs. (1.1) and (1.2), quadratic and interaction terms in the independent variables. </p>
<p>What are some of the criteria that can be used to guide the ex ante selection of an algebraic functional form for a particular economic relationship? Neither economic theory nor available empirical knowledge provide, in general, a sufficiently complete specification of the economic functional relationship so as to determine its precise algebraic form. Consequently the econometrician has wide latitude in deciding which one of many possible algebraic functional forms to use in building an econometric model. Through practice over the years, however, a set of criteria has evolved and developed. These criteria can be broadly classified into five categories:<br>(1) Theoretical consistency;<br>(2) Domain of applicability;<br>(3) Flexibility;<br>(4) Computational facility; and<br>(5) Factual conformity. </p>
<p>Theoretical consistency means that the algebraic functional form chosen must be capable of possessing all of the theoretical properties required of that particular<br>economic relationship for an appropriate choice of parameters. </p>
<p>We conclude that theoretical consistency, even if applied only locally, can indeed impose strong restrictions on the admissible range of the values of the parameters of an algebraic functional form. It is essential in any empirical application to verify that the algebraic functional form remains reasonably flexible even under all the restrictions imposed by the theory.</p>
<p>The domain of applicability of an algebraic functional form can refer to a number of different concepts. The most common usage of the domain of applicability refers to the set of values of the independent variables over which the algebraic functional form satisfies all the requirements for theoretical consistency.</p>
<p>Flexibility means the ability of the algebraic functional form to approximate arbitrary but theoretically consistent behavior through an appropriate choice of the parameters.</p>
<p>An algebraic functional form for a unit cost function C( p; a) is said to be flexible if at any given set of nonnegative (positive) prices of inputs the parameters of the cost function, (Y, can be chosen so that the derived unit-output input demand functions and their own and cross-price elasticities are capable of assuming arbitrary values at the given set of prices of inputs subject only to the requirements of theoretical consistency.” </p>
<p>The computational facility of a functional form implies one or more of the following properties.<br>(1) Its unknown parameters are easy to estimate from the data. Usually what this means is that the functional form is, after a known transformation if necessary, linear-in-parameters, and if there are restrictions on the parameters they are linear restrictions. This is called the “Linearity-in-Parameters” property.<br>(2) The functional form and any functions of interest derived from it are represented in explicit closed form.<br>(3) If the functional form pertains to a complete system, say, of either cost-minimizing input demand functions or consumer demand functions, the different functions in the same system should have the same algebraic form but different parameters. This is called the property of “Uniformity”. </p>
