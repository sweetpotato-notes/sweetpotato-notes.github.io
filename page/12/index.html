        <p>In economic development, developing countries in general face the common problem of determining the proper ratio between accumulation and consumption. That is, how does a country balance the demand for a vast  accumulation of capital to purchase advanced technology and equipment against the demand for huge expenditures to raise the standard of living? China, in the course of its economic development, has encountered some of these difficulties. Sometimes, it has managed the ratio properly and achieved good results; other times, it has managed poorly and created problems. The following are some aspects of the problem:</p>
<p> Many a contemporary developing country relies on foreign capital. China, however, prefers not to take this course; there is the potential danger that an overreliance on foreign capital may make China a vassal of other countries. China relies on its own resources and seeks external funds only as a supplement; i.e., it may borrow foerign capital but does not count solely on it.</p>
<p>China has its own policy. Although it, too, exports some natural resources and primary products in order to trade for construction material, that is not the long-range goal. China is aware of the facts that irrecoverable resources will run out sooner or later and that it can not build an independent national  economy by permanently relying on a foreign supply of equipment and technology. There is a Chinese saying, ‘Modernization cannot be purchased.’ Being a big socialist country, China must set up an independent and comprehensive economy of its own and rely primarily on its own ability to come up with the material and advanced technology needed for economic construction.</p>
<p>One can draw many valuable lessons from a review of China’s economic development.<br>First, in purchasing a policy of self-reliance, China should exercise caution in dealing with the problem of accumulation and consumption.<br>Second, during the course of large-scale capital construction, the level and rate of accumulation should be raised gradually within limits. Once the rate reaches a plateau, it should stay there because any sharp fluctuations in the accumulation rate would adversely affect the economy.<br>Third, China’s stress on accumulation without paying equal attention to investment efficiency was another major factor that caused its economic setbacks.</p>
<p>No doubt, the course that China chose to develop first – heavy industry so as to obtain material and technology needed for capital construction – created some difficulties in balancing consumption against accumulation, especially during the early period. The policy brought about three difficulties.<br>First, in order to rely primarily on its own efforts to accumulate capital, China needed to export large amounts of agricultural products and processed goods to pay for the imports of technology and capital goods.<br>Second, heavy industry, being capital intensive, requires huge amounts of funds and materials.<br>Third, heavy industry relies on agriculture and light industry to provide the raw materials for its production and consumer goods for its workers.</p>
<p>Drawing lessons from the grave mistakes the country has committed over the years of mishandling the relationship between consumption and accumulation, China has, since 1979, been bent on readjusting the ratio between consumption and accumulation, scaling down the latter to a reasonable level, gradually enhancing its efficiency, and rationally allocating funds among departments. To achieve the objectives, China has adopted a series of measures such as a slowdown of the speed in heavy industry; a reduction of investment in capital construction; a raise of workers’ wages and peasants’ income; a readjustment of the production structure, particularly the composition of heavy industry and a speedup of housing and urban construction; the acceleration of the development of science, culture, education, and public hygiene; a cutback in production costs; raising profits; etc.</p>
<p>After a year’s adjustment, the ratio between consumption and accumulation has begun to move in the right direction. Accumulation, which declined to 33.6 percent last year, will probably be 30 percent this year and even lower than that in the future. It is our conviction that the restoration of the balance between consumption and accumulation will ensure a healthy development of the national economy and a rapid improvement in the standard of living. </p>
