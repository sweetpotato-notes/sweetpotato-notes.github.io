        <p>There is a major debate on the role of technology and capital accumulation in the growth experiences of East Asian nations, particularly South Korea and Singapore. See Young (1991, 1995) for the argument that increases in physical capital and labor inputs explain almost all of the rapid growth in these two countries. See Klenow and Rodriguez (1997) and Hsieh (2002) for the opposite point of view.</p>
<p>An important feature of the Solow model, which is shared by many models presented in this book, is that it is a simple and abstract representation of a complex economy. At first, it may appear too simple or too abstract. After all, to do justice to the process of growth or marcoeconomic equilibrium, we have to consider households and individuals with different tastes, abilities, incomes, and roles in society; various sectors; and multiple social interactions. The Solow model cuts through these complications by constructing a simple one-good economy, with little reference to individual decisions. Therefore, the Solow model should be thought of as a straight point and a springboard for richer models.</p>
<p>The Solow model generates per capita output growth only by introducing exogenous technological progress. But in this case, everything is driven by technological progress, and technological progress itself is exogenous, just a black box, outside the model and outside the influence of economic incentives. If technological progress is ‘where it’s at,’ then we have to study and understand which factors generate technological progress, what makes some firms and societies invent better technologies, and what induces firms and societies to adopt and use these superior technologies.</p>
<p>Even on the question of capital accumulation, the Solow model is not entirely satisfactory. The rate of capital accumulation is determined by the saving rate, the depreciation rate, and the rate of population growth. All these rates are taken as exogenous.</p>
<p>There are two major (and related) problems with the regression approach and the conclusion that the importance of technology differences is limited.</p>
<p>The first relates to the assumption that technology differences across countries are orthogonal to all other variables. While the constant technology advances assumption may be defended, the orthogonality assumption is too strong, almost untenable. When Aj varies across countries, it should also be correlated with measures of Sjh and Sjk : countries that are more productive also invest more in physical and human capital. This correlation is for two reasons. The first is a version of the omitted variable bias problem: technology differences are also outcomes of investment decisions. Thus societies with high levels of Aj are those that have invested more in technology for various reasons; it is then natural to expect the same reasons to induce greater investment in physical and human capital as well. Second, even if we ignore omitted variable bias, there is a reverse causality problem: complementarity between technology and physical or human capital implies that countries with high Aj find it more beneficial to increase their stock of human and physical capital. In terms of the regression (3.26), omitted variable bias and reverse causality problems imply that the key right-hand-side variables are correlated with the error term, εj. Consequently, ordinary least squares regression of (3.26) lead to upwardly biased estimates of α and β. In addition, the estimation of R square, which is a measure of how much of the cross-country variability in income per capita can be explained by physical and human capital, will also be biased upward.</p>
<p>While complete agreement is not possible, it is safe to say that the consensus in the literature today favors the interpretation that cross-country differences in income per capita cannot be understood solely on the basis of differences in physical and human capital; in order words, there are technology differences across countries, and these technology differences are likely to be at the heart of cross-country income and growth differences.</p>
<p>‘The factors we have listed (innovation, economies of scale, education, capital accumulation, etc.) are not causes of growth; they are growth.’ (North and Thomas, 1973)</p>
<p>Returning to the first question, there are innumerable fundamental causes of economic growth that various economists, historians, and social scientists have proposed over the ages. Clearly, listing and cataloging the is neither informative nor useful. Instead, I classify the major candidate fundamental causes of economic growth into four categories of hypotheses. While such a classification undoubtedly fails to do justice to some of the nuances of the literature, it is satisfactory for our purposes of highlighting the main factors affecting cross-country income differences and economic growth. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The luck hypothesis,</p>
</li>
<li><p>The geography hypothesis,</p>
</li>
<li><p>The culture hypothesis, and </p>
</li>
<li><p>The institutions hypothesis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By ‘luck,’ I refer to the set of fundamental causes that explain divergent paths of economic performance among countries that are otherwise identical, either because some small uncertainty or heterogeneity between them has led to different choices with far-ranging consequences or because of different selection among multiple equilibria.</p>
<p>By ‘geography,’ I refer to all factors that are imposed on individuals as part of the physical, geographic, and ecological environment in which they live.</p>
<p>By ‘culture,’ I refer to beliefs, values, and preferences that influence individual economic behavior. Differences in religious beliefs across societies are among the clearest examples of cultural differences that may affect economic behavior. Differences in preferences, for example, regarding how important wealth is relative to other status-generating activities and how patient individuals should be, might be as important as – or even more important than – luck, geography, and institutions in affecting economic performance.</p>
<p>By ‘institutions,’ I refer to rules, regulations, laws, and policies that affect economic incentives and thus the incentives to invest in technology, physical capital, and human capital.</p>
<p>The economic historian Douglass North was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics largely because of his work emphasizing the importance of institutions in the historical development process. North (1990, p.3) offers the following definition:</p>
<p>Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction. </p>
<p>He goes on to emphasize the key implications of institutions:</p>
<p>In consequence [institutions] structure incentives in human exchange, whether political, social, or economic.</p>
<p>The most famous link between culture and economic development is that proposed by Max Weber (1930, p.11), who argued that the origins of industrialization in Western Europe could be traced to a cultural factor – the Protestant reformation and particularly the rise of Calvinism. Interestingly, Weber provided a clear summary of his views as a comment on Montesquieu’s arguments:</p>
<p>Motesquieu says of the English that they ‘had progressed the farthest of all peoples of the world in three important things in piety, in commerce, and in freedom.’ Is it not possible that their commercial superiority and their adaption to free political institutions are connected in some way with that record of piety which Montesquieu ascribes to them?</p>
<p>Weber argued that English piety, in particular, Protestantism, was an important driver of capitalist development. Protestantism led to a set of beliefs that emphasized hard work, thrift, and saving.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence estimating the different sources of variation in colonial history finds that property rights institutions are more important for current economic outcomes than are contracting institutions. Countries with greater constraints on politicians and elites and more protection against expropriation by these powerful groups appear to have substantially higher long-run growth rates and higher levels of current income. They also have significantly greater investment levels and generate more credit for the private sector. In contrast, the role of contracting institutions is more limited. Once the effects of property rights institutions are controlled for, contracting institutions seem to have no impact on income per capita, the ratio of investment to GDP, and the ratio of private credit to GDP. Contracting institutions appear to have some effect on stock market development, however. </p>
