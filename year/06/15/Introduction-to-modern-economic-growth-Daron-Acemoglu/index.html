        <p>There is a major debate on the role of technology and capital accumulation in the growth experiences of East Asian nations, particularly South Korea and Singapore. See Young (1991, 1995) for the argument that increases in physical capital and labor inputs explain almost all of the rapid growth in these two countries. See Klenow and Rodriguez (1997) and Hsieh (2002) for the opposite point of view.</p>
<p>An important feature of the Solow model, which is shared by many models presented in this book, is that it is a simple and abstract representation of a complex economy. At first, it may appear too simple or too abstract. After all, to do justice to the process of growth or marcoeconomic equilibrium, we have to consider households and individuals with different tastes, abilities, incomes, and roles in society; various sectors; and multiple social interactions. The Solow model cuts through these complications by constructing a simple one-good economy, with little reference to individual decisions. Therefore, the Solow model should be thought of as a straight point and a springboard for richer models.</p>
<p>The Solow model generates per capita output growth only by introducing exogenous technological progress. But in this case, everything is driven by technological progress, and technological progress itself is exogenous, just a black box, outside the model and outside the influence of economic incentives. If technological progress is ‘where it’s at,’ then we have to study and understand which factors generate technological progress, what makes some firms and societies invent better technologies, and what induces firms and societies to adopt and use these superior technologies.</p>
<p>Even on the question of capital accumulation, the Solow model is not entirely satisfactory. The rate of capital accumulation is determined by the saving rate, the depreciation rate, and the rate of population growth. All these rates are taken as exogenous.</p>
<p>There are two major (and related) problems with the regression approach and the conclusion that the importance of technology differences is limited.</p>
<p>The first relates to the assumption that technology differences across countries are orthogonal to all other variables. While the constant technology advances assumption may be defended, the orthogonality assumption is too strong, almost untenable. When Aj varies across countries, it should also be correlated with measures of Sjh and Sjk : countries that are more productive also invest more in physical and human capital. This correlation is for two reasons. The first is a version of the omitted variable bias problem: technology differences are also outcomes of investment decisions. Thus societies with high levels of Aj are those that have invested more in technology for various reasons; it is then natural to expect the same reasons to induce greater investment in physical and human capital as well. Second, even if we ignore omitted variable bias, there is a reverse causality problem: complementarity between technology and physical or human capital implies that countries with high Aj find it more beneficial to increase their stock of human and physical capital. In terms of the regression (3.26), omitted variable bias and reverse causality problems imply that the key right-hand-side variables are correlated with the error term, εj. Consequently, ordinary least squares regression of (3.26) lead to upwardly biased estimates of α and β. In addition, the estimation of R square, which is a measure of how much of the cross-country variability in income per capita can be explained by physical and human capital, will also be biased upward.</p>
<p>While complete agreement is not possible, it is safe to say that the consensus in the literature today favors the interpretation that cross-country differences in income per capita cannot be understood solely on the basis of differences in physical and human capital; in order words, there are technology differences across countries, and these technology differences are likely to be at the heart of cross-country income and growth differences.</p>
<p>‘The factors we have listed (innovation, economies of scale, education, capital accumulation, etc.) are not causes of growth; they are growth.’ (North and Thomas, 1973)</p>
<p>Returning to the first question, there are innumerable fundamental causes of economic growth that various economists, historians, and social scientists have proposed over the ages. Clearly, listing and cataloging the is neither informative nor useful. Instead, I classify the major candidate fundamental causes of economic growth into four categories of hypotheses. While such a classification undoubtedly fails to do justice to some of the nuances of the literature, it is satisfactory for our purposes of highlighting the main factors affecting cross-country income differences and economic growth. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The luck hypothesis,</p>
</li>
<li><p>The geography hypothesis,</p>
</li>
<li><p>The culture hypothesis, and </p>
</li>
<li><p>The institutions hypothesis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By ‘luck,’ I refer to the set of fundamental causes that explain divergent paths of economic performance among countries that are otherwise identical, either because some small uncertainty or heterogeneity between them has led to different choices with far-ranging consequences or because of different selection among multiple equilibria.</p>
<p>By ‘geography,’ I refer to all factors that are imposed on individuals as part of the physical, geographic, and ecological environment in which they live.</p>
<p>By ‘culture,’ I refer to beliefs, values, and preferences that influence individual economic behavior. Differences in religious beliefs across societies are among the clearest examples of cultural differences that may affect economic behavior. Differences in preferences, for example, regarding how important wealth is relative to other status-generating activities and how patient individuals should be, might be as important as – or even more important than – luck, geography, and institutions in affecting economic performance.</p>
<p>By ‘institutions,’ I refer to rules, regulations, laws, and policies that affect economic incentives and thus the incentives to invest in technology, physical capital, and human capital.</p>
<p>The economic historian Douglass North was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics largely because of his work emphasizing the importance of institutions in the historical development process. North (1990, p.3) offers the following definition:</p>
<p>Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction. </p>
<p>He goes on to emphasize the key implications of institutions:</p>
<p>In consequence [institutions] structure incentives in human exchange, whether political, social, or economic.</p>
<p>The most famous link between culture and economic development is that proposed by Max Weber (1930, p.11), who argued that the origins of industrialization in Western Europe could be traced to a cultural factor – the Protestant reformation and particularly the rise of Calvinism. Interestingly, Weber provided a clear summary of his views as a comment on Montesquieu’s arguments:</p>
<p>Motesquieu says of the English that they ‘had progressed the farthest of all peoples of the world in three important things in piety, in commerce, and in freedom.’ Is it not possible that their commercial superiority and their adaption to free political institutions are connected in some way with that record of piety which Montesquieu ascribes to them?</p>
<p>Weber argued that English piety, in particular, Protestantism, was an important driver of capitalist development. Protestantism led to a set of beliefs that emphasized hard work, thrift, and saving.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence estimating the different sources of variation in colonial history finds that property rights institutions are more important for current economic outcomes than are contracting institutions. Countries with greater constraints on politicians and elites and more protection against expropriation by these powerful groups appear to have substantially higher long-run growth rates and higher levels of current income. They also have significantly greater investment levels and generate more credit for the private sector. In contrast, the role of contracting institutions is more limited. Once the effects of property rights institutions are controlled for, contracting institutions seem to have no impact on income per capita, the ratio of investment to GDP, and the ratio of private credit to GDP. Contracting institutions appear to have some effect on stock market development, however. </p>
<p>There is a lively debate about whether the observed total factor productivity growth is partly a result of the mismeasurement of inputs. If so, it could be that much of what we measure as technological progress is in fact capital deepening, which is the essence of economic growth in the AK model and its variants. Consequently the debate about the measurement of total factor productivity has important implications for what types of models we should use for thinking about world economic growth and cross-country income differences. In the final analysis, however, it seems unlikely that some form of technological progress has not played an important role in the process of economic growth over the past 200 years.</p>
<p>The neoclassical growth model (or the simpler Solow growth model) has difficulty in generating the very large income differences across countries that we observe in the data. Even if we choose quite large differences in cross-country distortions (e.g., eightfold differences in effective tax rates), the implied steady-state differences in income per capita are relatively modest. As noted before, this observation has generated a large literature that seeks reasonable extensions of the neoclassical growth model in order to derive more elastic responses to policy distortions and so provide a better mapping of these models to differences across countries. The models presented in this chapter, like those that we will encounter in the next part of the book, suffer from the opposite problem. They imply that even small differences in policies, technological opportunities, or other characteristic of societies lead to permanent differences in long-run growth rates. Consequently these models can explain very large differences in living standards from small policy, institutional, or technological differences. But this ability is both a blessing and a curse. The by-product of generating large cross-country differences from small policy or technological differences is that these models also predict an ever-expanding world income distribution – countires with different characteristics should grow at permanently different rates. The relative stability of the world income distribution in the postwar era is then a challenge to the baseline endogenous growth models.</p>
<p>Although one can debate whether endogenous growth models, with each country growing at a potentially different long-run rate, are a better approximation to postwar data than models in which there is a stable world income distribution, at some level this debate is not particularly interesting. First, there is more to understanding the nature of the growth process and the role of technological progress than simply looking at the postwar data. The era of divergence is not the past 60 years, but the nineteenth century. Therefore we should not just focus on postwar data but also confront our growth models with historical data. These data are both richer and more informative about the era when the divergence aross countries began. Second, most economies do not generate their own technology by R&amp;D but largely import or adopt these technologies from more advanced nations (or from the world technology frontier). They also engage in substantial trade with other countries. Once technological, financial, and trade interdependences across countries are modeled, the sharp distinction between models of exogenous and endogenous growth disappears. This point again reiterates the potential pitfalls in modeling ‘each country as an island,’ especially when we wish to map these models to data.</p>
<p>Let us summarize the most important aspects and takeaway lessons of our analysis.<br>Growth as the source of current income differences.<br>The role of physical capital, human capital, and technology.<br>Endogenous investment decisions.<br>Endogenous technology.<br>Linkages across societies and balanced growth at the world level.<br>Takeoffs and failures.<br>Structural changes and transformations.<br>Policy, institutions, and political economy.<br>Endogenous political institutions.</p>
<p>Why did the world not experience sustained growth before 1800?<br>Four factors appear to have been particularly important and set these growth episodes apart from modern economic growth.<br>First, earlier episodes were relatively short-lived or took place at a relatively slow pace. In most cases, the initial spurt of growth soon crumbled for one reason or another, somehow reminiscent of the failed takeoffs in the model of Section 17.6 in Chapter 17.<br>Secondly and relatedly, growth was never based on continuous technological innovations; thus it never resembled the technology-based growth described in Chapter 13-15.<br>Third, in most cases economic institutions that would be necessary to support sustained growth did not develop. Financial relations were generally primitive, contracting institutions remained informal, markets were heavily regulated with various internal tariffs, and incomes and savings did not reach the levels necessary for the mass market and simultaneous investments in a range of activities to become profitable. Put differently, the structural transformations accompanying development discussed in Chapter 21 did not take place.<br>Fourth (and arguably most important and the cause of the first three), all these episodes took place within the context of authoritarian political regimes. They were not broad-based growth experiences. Instead, this was elite-driven growth for the benefit of the elite that largely exploited existing comparative advantages. Thus it is not surprising that the improvements in living standards did not affect the entire society but only a minority.</p>
<p>Let me next elaborate on the aspects of political economy that appear to be critical and provide a few examples to illustrate the limits to growth under authoritarian regimes. The available evidence shows that the Chinese empire was technologically innovative during many distinct phases of its history. Productivity in the Chinese economy, especially in the Yangtze Delta and other fertile lands, was high enough to support a high density of population. But the Chinese economy never came close to sustained growth. Authoritarian political institutions have regulated economic activity tightly for most of Chinese history. The society was hierarchical, with a clear distinction between the elite and the masses. This system did not allow free entry into business by new entrepreneurs who would adopt and exploit new technologies and unleash te powers of creative destruction. When prospects for economic growth conflicted with political stability, the elite opted for maintaining stability, even if this came at the expense of potential economic growth. Thus China tightly controlled overseas and internal trade, did not develop the broad-based property rights and contracting institutions necessary for modern economic growth, and did not allow an autonomous middle class to emerge as an economic and political force (Elvin, 1973; Mokyr, 1990; Wong, 1997)</p>
<p>It is also remarkable that in none of these cases did complementary economic institutions develop. Financial institutions remained rudimentary. The Roman Republic developed a precursor to the modern corporation and allowed some contracts between free citizens, but by and large economic prosperity was built on traditional economic activities that did not necessitate complex relationships among producers and between firms and workers. Consequently the structural transformations that accompany economic growth never took place in these societies. Life was largely rural, and social relations were dominated by the state and community enforcement. Perhaps more important, there was little investment in human capital, except for the elite for whom education was seldom a means to higher productivity. Without broad-based human capital and political rights, creative destruction becomes even more difficult as a large fraction of the population is barred from entrepreneurial activities. All of the cases discussed here confirm this expectation.</p>
<p>Overall, these cases illustrate that societies that encourage increases in the productivity of the elite in traditional activities can secure growth for a while. But they are unlikely to engender creative destruction. Growth goes hand-in-hand with the political domination of the elite and thus with entry barriers protecting the status and the power of the elite. In this light, the answer to the question of ‘why not before 1800’ is twofold. First, no society before 1800 invested in human capital, allowed new firms to bring new technology, and generally unleashed the powers of creative destruction. This failure might have been partly due to the difficulty of undertaking broad-based human capital investments in societies without the printing press and with only limited communication technologies. But it was also related to the reward structures for and constraints on workers and firms. An important consequence of this pattern of growth is that no society experienced the sweeping structural transformations that are an essential part of modern economic growth. Second, no society took steps toward sustained growth, because all these societies lived under authoritarian political regimes.</p>
<p>Why did economic takeoff start around 1800 and in western europe?<br>The division of labor (emphasized by Adam Smith) and capital accumulation always present growth opportunities to societies. Furthermore human ingenuity is strong enough to create room for major technological breakthroughs in almost any environment. Thus there is always a growth impetus in human societies (Jones, 1988). Nevertheless this impetus may only be latent because it exists in the context of a set of political (and economic) institutions. When these institutions do not encourage growth – when they do not provide the right kind of reward structure and so punish rather than reward innovations – we do not expect the growth impetus to lead to sustained growth. Even in such environments, economic growth is possible, and this is why China, Greece, Rome, and other empires experienced growth for part of their history. But this prosperity did not exploit the full growth impetus; instead, it took place in the context of political regimes that, by their nature, had to control the growth impetus, because this impetus would ultimately bring these regimes down.</p>
<p>West European growth starting in the late eighteenth century was different, because Western Europe underwent three important structural transformations starting in the late Middle Ages. These strutural transformations created an environment in which the latent growth impetus could turn into an engine of sustained growth.</p>
<p>The first was the collapse of one of the pillars of the ancient regime, the decline of feudal relations in Western Europe.</p>
<p>The second structural transformation was related. With the decline in population in the fourteenth century, real incomes increased in much of Europe, and many cities created sufficiently large markets for merchants to seek new imports and for industrialists to seek new products.</p>
<p>The thrid and most important change was political. The late Middle Ages also witnessed the start of a political process that inexorably led to the collapse of absolutist monarchies and to the rise of constitutional regimes.</p>
<p>These constitutional regimes, which emerged first in Britain and the Netherlands and then in France and other parts of Western Europe, paved the way for sustained economic growth based on property rights for a broad cross section of society, contract enforcement, the rule of law, and free entry into existing and new business lines. According to the theoretical perspective developed in earlier chapters, these improved conditions should have led to greater investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology. This is indeed what happened, and the process of modern economic growth was launched. Economic relations now relied on new businesses investing in industry, commerce, and the formation of complex organizational forms and production relations. Growth did not immediately accelerate. Economic growth was present but modest during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Maddison, 2001). But these institutional changes laid the foundations for the more rapid growth that was soon to come. Financial institutions developed, the urban areas expanded further, new technologies were invented, and markets became the primary arena for transactions and competition (North and Thomas, 1973). By 1800, the process of technological change and investment had progressed so much as to be dubbed the ‘Industrial Revolution’ (Ashton, 1969; Mokyr, 1993). The first phase of the Industrial Revolution was followed by the production of yet newer technologies, more complex organizations, greater reliance on skills and human capital in the production process, and increasing globalization of the world economy. By the second half of the nineteenth century, Western Europe had reached unprecedented growth levels.</p>
