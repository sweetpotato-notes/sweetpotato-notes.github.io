        <p>Although the fact has not always been recognized explicitly, the neoclassical model is based squarely on the assumption that transaction costs are zero. At first glance, such a simplification may appear to be both innocuous and highly useful to analysis. This assessment, however, is dubious. The concept of costless transactions has very far reaching consequences for microeconomic theory and leads to a model of the economic universe that is difficult to interpret consistently. In the rarefied world of zero transaction costs, decision makers can, supposedly, acquire and process any information they wish instantly and costlessly. They possess perfect foresight and, hence, are able to write complete contracts – contracts that can be monitored and enforced with absolute precision. Force, in all its forms, is perfectly monopolized by the state. Consequently, there can exist no strikes, no boycotts, no sit-ins, no need for political correctness or other forms of social pressure. The power of coercion is exclusively in the hands of the state. Quite simply, then, it seems that, under neoclassical thinking, the setting in which economic activity is assumed to take place is remarkably specialized and remote from reality. While abstraction can be useful, there is good reason to believe that the neoclassical approach is overly abstract and incapable of dealing adequtely with many current problems of interest to theorists and policymakers.</p>
<p>It should also be noted at this point that, in neoclassical theory, the price system is the only (explicitly modeled) device that is identified as a means for coordinating different activities. Administrative coordination is disregarded because it is generally not thought to be necessary in a market-driven system. Thus, coordination within institutions such as firms is viewed as taking place in a ‘black box.’ That is, whatever is presumed to happen beyond straightforward market transactions is not modeled.</p>
<p>In general, the representatives of the NIE have not been content to merely criticize orthodox neoclassical theory. Rather, they have attempted to produce new theoretical constructs capable of explaining areas of economic life that have previously been ignored and of showing why certain neoclassical theorems cannot be validated in real life. A first step was to consider why the existence of positive transaction costs makes it necessary to view institutions as endogenous variables in the economic model. The answer, of course, is that in the real world institutional structure affects both transaction costs and individual incentives and hence economic behavior. Once this set of relations is acknowledged, it follows that new, more refined economic models must appear.</p>
<p>The essential point to be noted is this. In attempting to answer the question of whether a competitive market economy with or without private ownership rights in firms is the more efficient social arrangement, one needs a model in which property-rights structure plays a central role. Institutionally neutral general equilibrium theory is simply not appropriate for the purpose of comparing different institutional arrangements (Richter 1992a). In general, the concept of economic efficiency needs rethinking when something other than the frictionless neoclassical world is considered. And the problems of efficiency definition are compounded when the issue is one of proper institutional choice (Furubotn and Richter 1991, 11ff.).</p>
<p>As a result of the imperfections in the real world, formal institutional arrangements such as constitutions, laws, contracts, and charters are inevitably incomplete. This inherent limitation should be recognized and dealt with as far as possible. Important instruments of the type noted should be written in such a way as to leave room for their rapid adaption to unforseen circumstances through the spontaneous development of informal rules. Following this flexible approach, the difficulties caused by uncertainty and asymmetric information can be reduced. Thus, during the last two decades, the New Institutional Economics has placed increasing emphasis on the need to view institutional design from the perspective of unavoidable incompleteness.</p>
<p>The basic difference between perfect competition in economics and in politics is ‘the utter dispersion of power’ (Stigler 1968, 181) – in the first case (strictly voluntary exchange), while in the second case the use of power or force is indispensable. An invisible hand mechanism can at best be imagined to lead to an equilibrium of power in the sense of a Nash equilibrium, which – as in the case of perfect competition – works only under ideal conditions of information. Still, some economists, economic historians, and political scientists do apply this ‘institution-as-an-equilibrium-of-a-game’ approach to deal with the pervasive presence of coercive power in polities (e.g., Grieif 1998c, 2005; Weingast 1998; Aoki 2001). To a similar category belong theories of special interest politics (Grossman and Helpman 2001) or of modern political economics (Persson and Tabellini 2000; Drazen 2000).</p>
<p>It should be noted that a theory of institutions may not lead to the conclusion that unique institutional equilibria will always emerge (Schotter 1981,12).</p>
<p>Brief mention can be made of other factors that affect institutional development. Agency relationships influence social processes and raise special problems because of informational asymmetries. Inevitably, there are important interconnections between economic and political activities. And, finally, we know that prevailing customs and, in general, history matter for the success or failure of institutional change and that there are limits to institutional engineering. The path dependency of institutional change and the ideological and emotional predispositions of the public always have to be taken into account.</p>
<p>The costs of using the market may be classified in more detail as follows:<br>(1) the costs of preparing contracts (search and information costs narrowly defined),<br>(2) the costs of concluding contracts (cost of bargaining and decision making),<br>(3) the costs of monitoring and enforcing the contractual obligations,<br>(4) the costs of establishing and tending social relations. Burt (1992a) calls such investments ‘social capital.’</p>
<p>As will be shown, the economic incentives generated under a regime of private property contribute, in general, to the efficient, nonwasteful use of scarce resources and hence to social welfare. In the case of environmental wealth, for example, it is the impossibility of making a complete assignment of property rights in resources to individuals, and not provite ownership as such, that explains environmental problems. Of course, the distributive aspects of private ownership may also create social difficulties, but these difficulties are not necessarily solved by social (or collective) ownership.</p>
<p>In general, a capitalist owner has an incentive to attend to his property according to its actual or expected market value. Contrary to the situation in a zero-transaction-cost world with perfect information, property rights and markets in property rights matter. In effect, the market value of an asset and its allocation are ‘controlled’ by its supply and demand. Individuals compete on asset markets for ownership and thus make use of the society’s scattered resources a society can find. Each resource will go to the particular owner who in question are backed in each case, by the willingness of the purchaser to risk his own wealth in the transaction. Private ownership thus contributes, in an essential way, to the solution of the economic problem of society – the utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in totality (Hayek 1945).</p>
<p>Given our assumptions (bounded rationality and positive transaction costs), it is evident that, under ideal conditions, ‘all resources should be owned by someone, except resources so plentiful that everybody can consume as much of them as he wants without reducing consumption by anyone else…’ (Posner 1972b,29). Posner calls this the criteria for what he calls ‘an efficient system of property rights.’ The second criterion is exclusivity of property rights, and the third is transferability of rights. These three criteria, together with the assumption of individual rationality, are said to ensure that individuals will endeavor, through appropriate actions, to maximize the value of their property and thus also further the ‘wealth of nations.’</p>
<p>From what has been said so far, it should be clear that freely transferable private property plays a fundamental role in a market economy. Conditions in the economy that impede exchange have the general consequence of reducing efficiency. Private property provides both the incentive effect of ownership and the necessary control effect of competition – that is, the carrot ad stick combination that tends to promote economic success. Nutter, with an eye on socialist market models, puts the issue as follows: Markets without divisible and transferable property rights are a sheer illusion. There can be no competitive behavior, real or simulated, without dispersed power and responsibility. (1968, 144)</p>
<p>Property in one’s own person: human rights: Human rights do not belong to the category of property rights in the legal sense of the word, not even in the wide, common law sense of the term. But for institutional economists, who are concerned with norms of behavior more in their incentive than their litigational aspects, human rights may very well be discussed using concepts of property-rights analysis. Thus, the liberal state’s right of human self-determination may be, and actually was, interpreted by John Locke as ‘property in one’s own person.’ The similarity of this right to the right of private ownership of things is striking of one reads the relevant German laws. Yet one important difference must be noted. A person is not allowed to sell his right to human self-determination, that is, a person cannot enslave himself. In the liberal state, slavery is forbidden.</p>
<p>Note in this context that Marx and Engels (1848), and subsequent radical thinkers, demanded not only the abolition of private property in the means of production but also the abolition of such social relationships as the family and national and religious affiliations. Thus, as the Communist Manifesto states: ‘The communist revolution breaks most radically with traditional property relationships’. Marx and Engels also insisted on restricting the right to human self-determination by demanding ‘equal compulsion to work for all, [and] foundation of industrial armies, in particular in agriculture’.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, whatever the assignment of rights turns out to be, if zero transaction costs are assumed, individuals will (ideally) trade some of their rights away until a Pareto-efficient allocation of resources has been realized (i.e., until the marginal benefit of the transfer is just equal to the marginal disbenefit). This understanding is the central message of the so called Coase theorem in its general form (Coase 1960). Another, more specialized interpretation of the theorem is that the organizational arrangement reached will be independent of the initial assignment of property rights.</p>
<p>Those writers favoring a more literary or verbal approach to economics have tended to incorporate substantial descriptive detail when analyzing contractural relationships. On the other side, there are scholars who operate at a more abstract theoretical level, and these writers have tended to make extensive use of mathematical and logical tools in reaching conclusions. Given the differences between groups, it is understandable that their constructs show certain distinctive characteristics. Verbal theorists, avoiding the rigidity of mathematical models, have had greater freedom for developing and applying their ideas to real-world cases. But this flexibility has been secured at the cost of working with less precisely defined concepts and, at times, reaching conclusions with only limited regard for rigorous derivation. Mathematical model builders, on the other hand, may achieve charity and precision in exposition, but they pay the price of having a rather narrow analytical focus and of being somewhat restricted in their capacity to pursue broad new themes (DeAlessi 1990; Furubotn 1990). In this connection, Williamson (1993b) has warned of the dangers of ‘prematurely formal theory.’</p>
<p>Positive agency theory comes to the conclusion that agency costs, which result from the asymmetric information held by the respective parties, are influenced by the pattern of residual-claim holding and the allocation of decision-making rights. In the case of small, noncomplex firms, the restriction of residual claims to ‘owners’ (decision makers) substitutes for costly control devices to limit the discretion of agents. The price of this arrangement, though, is that the benefits of unrestricted risk sharing cannot be reaped. On the other hand, in the case of large, complex firms, residual risk bearing and decision making should be separated, and, in addition, decision making should be seperated in the management and control of decisions. Such separation and diffusion of decision management and decision control limits the power of individual agents to infringe upon the interests of the residual claimants.</p>
<p>Asymmetri information is the basic assumption of the principal-agent approach in which the agent enjoys some informational advantage over the principal. The principal may be, for example, the owner of a firm and the agent his manager. More generally, the principal may be the employer, the agent the employee, and son on. Two types of asymmetric information are distinguished in this connection, depending on whether the parties are asymmetrically informed before and up to the moment of contract conclusion or thereafter. In the literature, two types are referred to as adverse selection (precontractual asymmetric information) and moral hazard (postcontractual asymmetric information). The better-informed party is tempted to engage in precontractual opportunism in the first case and postcontractual opportunism in the second. Furthermore, in the latter, the moral hazard case, one distinguishes between hidden information (the agent has acquired some information that the principal has not) and hidden action (e.g., the effort level of the agent, which is unobservable by the principal).</p>
<p>At this point, it will be useful to make some general comments on the basic principal-agent model of the moral hazard type with hidden action.</p>
<ol>
<li>The asymmetric information assumption implies that acquiring information requires the use of resources. As a result, welfare losses due to informational constraints are generally unavoidable. The resulting agency costs may be regarded as some type of transaction cost. In this respect, the model differs from the neoclassical contingent-claims contract literature.</li>
<li>The informational constraints do not concern the future.</li>
<li>In the PA approach (and not only in its basic versions), the mix of informational constraints, on the one hand, and perfect information, on the other, is quite striking. The principal knows perfectly his agent’s preferences and reservation utility. Both know perfectly the profit or result function with the stochastic properties of the influences of nature on the results. On the other hand, the principal is blind with respect to the effort exerted by his agent and the actual moves of nature. In this case, information costs are extremely high in one respect while they are zero in all the rest.</li>
<li>Perfect rationality on the part of both the principal and the agent is assumed.</li>
<li>Contracts are complete in the sense that, once concluded, they are (and can be) executed as agreed upon.</li>
<li>‘The main insight of the basic Hidden Action Model is that the optimal incentive scheme looks like one based on an inference about the agent’s action from observable signals’ (Hart and Holmstrom 1987,105).</li>
<li>The extreme sensitivity of the incentive schedule to information variables is at odds with reality. ‘Real world schemes are simpler than the theory would dictate and surprisingly uniform across a wide range of circumstances…. The conclusion is that something other than informational issues drive whatever regularities one might observe’ (Hart and Holmstrom 1987,105).</li>
