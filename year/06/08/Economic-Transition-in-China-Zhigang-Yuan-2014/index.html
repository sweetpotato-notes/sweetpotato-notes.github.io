        <p>China’s economic miracle is achieved by its globalization strategy.</p>
<p>In China’s case, it is clear that, since the reform and opening up in the 1980s, net FDI inflows continue to increase.</p>
<p>Global industry transfer is a strong external driving force of the transition of China’s economic structure and China’s economic growth.</p>
<p>As in internal driving force of China’s economic growth, the institutional change due to reform and opening up since 1978 promoted economic development, and started China’s high-speed economic growth for more than 30 years. As Deng Xiaoping said, China’s economic reform is ‘touching the stones and gradually moving forward.’ At different stages of development, the obstacles of economic development are different, and the goal of the reform is also different at each stage. Therefore, China’s main drivers of economic growth in the past 30 years are not the same at different stages of development.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the main driving force of China’s economic growth, the 30 years of China’s economic miracle can be divided into four stages: rural land reform, rural industrialization, urban reform, and joining the WTO.</p>
<p>Stage 1: Rural Land Reform<br>The first stage of China’s initial economic reform started from the third plenary session of the 11th Communist Party of China (CPC) (1978-1984) the focus of which was in rural areas.</p>
<p>Rural productivity enhancement resulted from the change of land-use patterns due to the rural household contract responsibility system. The shift from collective focus to the family-farm model motivated farmer’s enthusiasm for agricultural production and liberated rural labor forces. Therefore, this period of economic growth was mainly driven by the systematic reform of rural land use. Because the added value of land production is much smaller than modern industrial production, the primary driving force of economic growth gradually became weak after several years of rapid development of agriculture. In order to further boost economic growth considering policy obstacles, China started the policy of ‘leaving the land but not the country,’ which means the transfer of agricultural labor to non-agricultural labor within the rural areas. The policy started the reform of rural township enterprises, and the Chinese economy entered the second stage of economic reforms.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Rural Industrialization<br>The second stage of China’s economic reforms is the industrialization in rural areas (1985-1991).</p>
<p>In some ways, labor productivity is generally lower in the township enterprises. Therefore, one the SOEs in the city are reformed, the technical, market, and capital advantages of the SOEs in the city put the township enterprises at a disadvantage. The township enterprises gradually declined with the deepening of reform of the SOEs in the city.</p>
<p>Stage 3: The Start and Deepening of Urban Reform<br>As early as in Oct 1984, the CPC’s 12th Central Committee adopted ‘the CPC Central Committe decision on the reform of the economic system.’ These programmatic documents show that China began reform in its urban areas. Deng Xiaoping’s ‘South tour speeches’ and the convening of the CPC 14th Central Committee marking China’s market-oriented economic system completely determine the establishment of a modern enterprise system, which started from the reform of SOEs and the financial system. It is the stage of starting and deepening the reform of the city (1992-2002), which highlights the reform of SOEs. Through the reform of SOEs, the urban market increased the efficiency of resource distribution and enhanced the competitiveness of urban enterprises, and therefore, the dominant role of township enterprises is changed in the industrialization process.</p>
<p>China’s reform of SOEs used a progressive reform thought, reforming the less difficult field before the hard ones, allowing local pilots before universal implementation, changing the competitive industries before the monopoly ones, and adjusting the assignment of power within the planned system before institutional innovations.</p>
<p>In the stage of deepening city reform, China’s driving force of economic growth came from two sources. The first is the optimization of the SOE operating mechanism that improved the operation efficiency of SOEs (Groves et al. 1994; Bai Zhongen et al., 2006), which enhanced China’s economic growth. The second source is the privatization of SOEs. It strengthened the market power of resource allocation and promoted economic growth efficiently (Zhang Weiyin and Su Shuhe, 1998).</p>
<p>Stage 4: China’s Economic Growth After Joining the WTO<br>On Dec 11, 2001, China formally joined the WTO, and the Chinese economy participated in economic globalization more actively. Both in terms of the absolute amount of the total import and export and the total import and export share of GDP, joining the WTO was a landmark event.</p>
<p>China’s foreign-funded enterprises promote the export of China’s manufacturing goods, and boost the comparative advantage of labor-intensive products. China’s active participation in the capital and technology-intensive industries gradually weakens its comparative disadvantage in these products (Song Jing, 2005).</p>
<p>After joining the WTO, reform of SOEs has been accelerated. The introduction of foreign strategic investors changes the SOE business models dramatically in the financial sector, and thereby strengthens the market allocation of resources and results in considerable development of SOEs and private enterprises.</p>
<p>With the improvement of China’s economic growth and income levels, Chinese household consumption is also an important aspect of China’s economic growth. Housing needs and home appliances upgrading stimulates the domestic demand-led economic growth in China. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the investment role of real estate is the most spectacular in the past 10 years. With the support of financial credit, China’s real estate market has developed rapidly and increased the consumers’ housing demand. Meanwhile, investment in domestic cement, steel, and other real estate-related industries is expanding. The reliance on land finance encourages the local government, fueling the bubble of real estate. The investment in real estate and infrastructure also became the most important driving force of China’s economic growth after joining the WTO, and hardened the structural change of China’s development in the future.</p>
<p>In different stages of China’s economic growth, we can see the different driving forces of China’s development. It also shows that there are different principal conflicts at each stage of China’s growth during the 30 years from reform and opening up, in which the government plays a very important role.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the external economic environment’s impact on China’s economic growth, China’s external environment for development changed significantly after the subprime crisis. China has faced challenges of unsustainable economic development using an export-led growth strategy.</p>
<p>The main feature of China’s old economic external model was fully using the comparative advantage of labor at the cost of price distortion of land, natural resources, and environment (low price), and stagnation of factor market development. The local government directly participates in economic activities as an important player, who invests and introduces external funding. Driven by the profit-oriented operation of international capital, factors of global production are distributed efficiently in China, the manufacturing sector develops quickly, and the capacity of commodity production increases sharply. Production has to be export-oriented due to insufficient domestic demand, which is caused by low labor income. Because of the seriously dual structure of the Chinese economy, both the opportunity cost of labor in agricultural sector and manufacturing sector’s wages are low. The hukou (Household Registration System in China) restrictions, the inconsistency of industrialization and urbanization, and the lack of social security and social welfare for migrant workers tend to lower labor costs, eventually leading to insufficient demand. This process in fact means that millions of Chinese workers are combined with sophisticated global production factors (capital, technology, management, brand, and intellectual) and form the Chinese manufacturing base, maintaining China’s more than 30 years of economy growth in the way of intensive development.</p>
<p>The financial crisis in 2008 is an important turning point of globalization, which also changed the external environment of China’s economic development.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China’s sustainable growth requires accelerating the transformation of foreign economic development policy, advancing the opening up toward optimizing the economic structure, and realizing efficiency-oriented changes.</p>
<p>During the process of China’s economic development, the adjustment of the relationship between the government and the market is a very significant aspect. The government played an important role in the reform for the past 30 years.</p>
<p>However, with the changes in China’s economic structure, the growth driven by the distortion of the price of factor markets cannot be sustained. In order to fundamentally change the relationship between the government and the market and to develop the impetus that drives China’s economy more sustainably, there are three challenges that must be addressed. The first is the reasonable definition of the boundaries of the government and the market; the second is the balance of the administrative authority and the fiscal authority between the central government and local governments; and the third is equal rights of the SOEs and private enterprises.</p>
<p>If the rationalization of the relationship between the government and the market is carried out by the way of efficient transformation of government functions, the market mechanism will take a greater role in improving the efficiency of resource allocation. Moreover, the motivation of market entities will be greatly enhanced, and thus, China’s economic vitality and innovation will be strengthened. All these combine to give sustainable impetus to China’s economic growth.</p>
<p>In the current system, for local government, first the pattern of competition between local governments is a kind of ‘GDP Championship’ that promotes increasing regional development. But this competition also brings about issues such as ‘local protectionism’ and ‘redundant construction,’ thus resulting in some consequences such as the interregional blockade and severe fragmentation in the product market and factor markets, impediment of further labor and capital flow to the big cities, severe industrial isomorphism across different areas, and excessive competition between cities and waste of resource.</p>
<p>Therefore, local governments need some kind of transition from land-based finance to land-based taxation and from the economic constructors to the public goods providers.</p>
<p>The level of urbanization is far behind that of industrialization, for several reasons: First, even since the early stage of industrialization beginning in the late 1970s, the population scale of rural and agricultural workers is very large and the urbanization rate has a very low starting point. Second, the policy orientation of China’s economic development also acts as a very important effect. China adopted a catching-up industrialization strategy of giving priority to heavy industry and distorted the price of capital to promote economic development. This strategy also results in industrialization ahead of urbanization. Third, since 1980, China has a long-term implementation of urbanization policies of ‘strict control of major cities, proper development of medium-sized cities, and vigorous development of small towns’ and rural industrialization policies of ‘shift from farming to other trades within the rural area and work in the plant without entering into the city.’ These policies are a serious impediment to the general development of urbanization. The fourth is the imperfection of China’s land system, due to which land urbanization is faster than population urbanization in the development of the realty industry. So China’s urbanization development lags far behind industrialization (Chen Jiagui et al., 2012).</p>
<p>In 2011, the proportion of population over 65 years accounted for 9.1% of the total population. According to the United Nations, in 2000, China was an aging society. Compared to the developed countries, which are already aging societies, China has become a society that is aging before getting rich. This situation increases the difficulty for China to solve the aging problem from the economic level. The untimely arrival of aging of population in China has an adverse and far-reaching impact on economic development now.</p>
<p>And in terms of economy, China’s untimely aging poses many challenges to economic development.<br>First, aging has a significant effect on the scale and structure of labor supply. And this prematurely weakens China’s comparative advantages in the global industrial chain.<br>Second, the untimely arrival of aging also affects the demand structure. And with the aging process, the society needs relevant investment in the aging service industry. As a result, investments in other fields, which can promote the innovation and economic development more rapidly, will be decreased.<br>Third, aging also poses challenges to the entire pension insurance system.<br>Fourth, aging problems will deplete savings, lower the level of savings, and furthermore decrease the investment level; this will inevitably inhibit the potential of China’s economic growth.</p>
<p>China is a country with relatively poor natural resources in terms of ownership per capita, and the resources constraint limits economic and social development. The importance of resources in the information age relatively drops, but land, water, forest, minerals, and oil resource are still the material foundation of economic development.</p>
<p>Therefore, sustainable economic development has to be environment-friendly in modern China. China has to start the reform of energy prices and distribute the resources efficiently. Only through changing the resource-using method, promoting the technological innovation, and reducing the environmental costs, can China’s sustainable growth be gained in the future.</p>
<p>At present, the debate on the Chinese economy reform is fierce. Overall, there are three opinions about the future path of the Chinese economy reform.<br>As for the first opinion, Chinese economic reform should take a top-down strategy, emphasizing an overall roadmap for further reform.<br>As for the second opinion, Chinese economic reform should take a bottom-up strategy. The top-down strategy is not feasible mainly because there is a contradiction between the market-oriented reform and the government-oriented reform.<br>Next, the top-down strategy and the bottom-up strategy should be combined to solve problems during the process of Chinese economic reform. On the one hand, the reform should proceed through searching the key field for the reform. On the other hand, the government and the market should focus on different fields.<br>However, what is the most important field in the reform is still a question; and there is no specific guideline for the combination of top-down strategy and bottom-up strategy.</p>
<p>One aim of the reform is to solve the unsustainable problem of an export-oriented economy. Therefore, how to balance foreign relations becomes one of the most important strategic issues.</p>
<p>As for domestic reform, the primary task of Chinese economic reform is the transformation of government functions. The public service function should be clear for both the central government and local government.</p>
<p>Factor market reform is the key field for Chinese economic reform, through which the problems caused by the structural imbalance will be solved and the efficiency of resource allocation will be improved.</p>
<p>Land market reform is the second most important reform. </p>
<p>The reform of the household registration system could be one important sub-field reform of the labor market.</p>
