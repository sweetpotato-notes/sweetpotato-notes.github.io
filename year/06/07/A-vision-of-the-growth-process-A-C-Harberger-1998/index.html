        <p>There is no analytical reason to prefer one of the above three terms over another, in referring to the residual R’. But I am going a bit out on a limb to say that a term like ‘technical change’ leads most economists to think of inventions, of the products of research and development (R&amp;D), and of what we might call technical innovations. On the other hand, TFP improvement, once purged of the changes in the quality of labor and/or the direct contributions of human capital, makes one think of externalities of different kinds – economies of scale, spillovers, and systematic complementarities. And finally, real cost reduction, to my mind, makes one think like an entrepreneur or a CEO, or a production manager.</p>
<p>A 1001 feedbacks would be out of the question, but one feedback would work just fine. Thus Paul Romer (1986) focused on a feedback through ‘knowledge,’ with the stock of knowledge shifting production functions all over the economy; Robert E. Lucas, Jr. (1988) focused on ‘human capital,’ not on its direct and remunerated productivity, but on the externalities that each increase in the stock of human capital were presumed to generate. These single feedbacks achieved the limited purpose of endogenizing R or R’ within a specified model, but they did not represent very well the multifaceted nature of real cost reduction as we observe it in actuality. And, in point of fact, both the cited authors in their more recent writings display a deep recognition of the subtlety and complexity of the growth process, not really capable of being captured through a simple feedback mechanism. (See Romer, 1990, 1994a,b; Lucas, 1993.)</p>
<p>The analogy with yeast and mushrooms comes from the fact that yeast causes bread to expand very evenly, like a balloon being filled with air, while mushrooms have the habit of popping up, almost overnight, in a fashion that is not easy to predict. I believe that a ‘yeast’ process fits best with very broad and general externalities, like externalities linked to the growth of the total stock of knowledge or of human capital, or brought about by economies of scale tied to the scale of the economy as a whole. A ‘mushroom’ process fits more readily with a vision such as ours, of real cost reductions stemming from 1001 different causes, though I recognize that one can build scenarios in which even 1001 causes could work rather evenly over the the whole economy.</p>
<p>What I see in TFP performance is quite analogous to what I see in the stock market pages of the newspaper. There are winners and losers every day, every month, and every year. The gains and losses come from all sorts of causes. World price shocks can drive firms into negative TFP performance if the consequence output reductions are greater than the reductions of inputs. So, too, can cyclical or secular declines in demand, including those caused by the successful actions of competitors.</p>
<p>To me, Joseph A. Schumpeter’s vision (1934) of ‘creative destruction’ captures much of the story. What he is saying is, yes, it’s a jungle out there, but the processes of that jungle are at the core of the dynamics of a market-oriented economy. They are what got us to where we are, and they hold the best promise for further progress in the future.</p>
<p>The springboard for the following listing of policy implications is the interpretation of the growth residual as representing real cost reduction and the ready acceptance that in the real world RCR comes in 1001 different forms.<br>(a) The first key observation is that people must perceive real cost in order to reduce them.<br>(b) A second policy implication is, in the words of my friend and longtime collaborator Ernesto Fontaine, avoid ‘prices that lie’ (precios mentirosos).<br>(c) Just as bad, and often even worse than direct distortions, are the excess costs imposed on an economy by ill-conceived regulations and bureaucratic hurdles.<br>(d) Although international trade distortions (tariffs, quotas, licenses, prohibitions, etc.) might be subsumed under points (b) and (c), their importance merits a seperate heading.<br>(e) The recent wave of privatizations among both developed and developing economies may have important effects in enabling real cost reductions that otherwise might have been delayed, or not have happened at all.<br>(f) One cannot complete a list like this without mentioning something that most of us simply take for granted – a sound legal and institutional framework in which individuals are protected against arbitrary incursions on their property and other economic rights.<br>(g) Somewhat related to the above is the element of political consensus concerning the broad outlines of economic policy.</p>
<p>Let me now try to summarize my own vision of the growth process – the major elements of which have been presented here. In the first plance we have the five standard pillars of growth – the rate of increase in the labor force, the rate of increase in the stock of human capital, the increase in the capital stock (net investment as a fraction of value added), the rate of return which that investment will yield (or can be expected to yield) and, last but not least, real cost reductions stemming from 1001 different sources.</p>
<p>What I hope to have evoked in this paper is a sense that the perfecting of economic processes can also in nearly all cases be justified as greasing the wheels of the constant search for new avenues of real cost reduction. To the extent that economic reforms do so, they become vehicles for bringing an economy to a point where, year after year, new, cheaper, and better ways are found of doing things, not just in so-called ‘production’ but also in such mundane areas as merchandising, sales, finance, insurance, and many more.</p>
<p>To me, the dynamics of real cost reduction are at the very least an important piece of what people have in mind when they list efficiency-oriented policies as essential ingredients of a program promoting economic growth. It is policies of this type that give the right signals to the CEOs and the managers down the line, that take away trammels that impede their quest for real cost reductions, and that create an environment in which Schumpeter’s process of ‘creative destruction’ can work its wonders.</p>
