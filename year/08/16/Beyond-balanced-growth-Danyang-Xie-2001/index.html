        <p>Balanced growth models are widely used in macroecoomics because they are consistent with the well-known Kaldor facts regarding economic growth. Kaldor stressed that the growth rate of output, the capital-output ratio, the real interest rate, and the labour income share are all roughly constant over time. The constancy of these ‘great ratios’ provides a good characterization of the long run behavior of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Just as important as these regularities stressed by Kaldor is the massive reallocation of labour from agriculture into manufacturing and services that accompanies the growth process. This reallocation process, often called ‘structural change’, has been documented by authors such as Clark (1940), Kuznets (1957) and Chenery (1960). A few numbers help to put this phenomenon into perspective. In 1870 the U.S. share of employment in agriculture was 40%. One hundred years later, agriculture accounted for only 4% of employment. Services, which accounted for 20% of employment in 1870, absorbed 40% of the labour force by 1970. We refer to the main regularities of this reallocation process as the Kuznets facts.</p>
<p>The macroeconomics and growth literature, which makes heavy use of balanced growth models, generally disregards the dramatic sectoral reallocation of labour experienced by all expanding economies. In contrast, there is a literature on structural change that ignores the Kaldor facts, in part because it focuses on a longer time period for which these facts may not apply (e.g. Baumol (1967), Pasinetti (1981), Park (1995), Echevarria (1997) and Laitner (2000)).</p>
<p>Is there a growth model that is consistent with both the Kaldor facts and the massive sectoral labour reallocation experienced in the U.S. during the last century? A first sight the answer to this question is no. After all, one property of balanced growth models is that the fraction of capital and labour allocated to different industries remain constant over time. We show that the two set of facts however can be reconciled, provided that a knife-edge condition is satisfied. The model we propose displays a generalized balanced growth (GBG) path – a trajectory that retains the key features of balanced growth and is consistent with the dynamics of structural change.</p>
<p>Balanced growth paths are easy to study. The fact that all variables grow at a constant rate transforms tye system of difference equations that describes the economy’s competitive equilibrium into a system of static equations that can be easily solved. This system also delivers the vector of initial values for the capital stocks that is consistent with balanced growth. The generalied balanced growth path in out model shares these attractive features. The GBG path and the corresponding vector of initial conditions can be characterized analytically, even though some variables have time-varying growth rates.</p>
<p>In addition to observing that the rate of economic expansion differs widely across countries, Kaldor proposed the following well-known set of empirical regularities.</p>
<p>The Kaldor facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Per capita output grows at a rate that is roughly constant;</li>
<li>The capital-output ratio is roughly constant;</li>
<li>The real rate of return to capital is roughly constant;</li>
<li>The shares of labour and capital in national income are roughly constant.</li>
</ol>
<p>The data displayed in Figure 1 shows that the Kaldor facts are a good shorthand description of the U.S. growth process. But while these facts suggest that the growth process is smooth, this impression is quickly shattered once we move beyond these aggregate statistics to the simplest level of industry disaggregation.</p>
<p>Are the sectoral movements documented in Figure 2 peculiar to the U.S. economy, or are they a general feature of economic development? Kongsamut et al. (1999) studies both a long-run data set comprising 22 countries and a cross-section data set of 123 non-socialist countries for the period 1970-1989. Both data sets confirm the development regularities depicted in Figure 2. Growth in per capita income tends to be accompanied by a rise in services and a decline in the agricultural sector, both in terms of labour employment and relative weight in GDP.</p>
<p>The assumption that only manufacturing output can be invested is consistent with the U.S. input-output tables.</p>
<p>Given the economy’s production structure, sectoral movements must originate from differences in the income elasticity of demand for the different goods.</p>
<p>These preferences imply that the income elasticity of demand is less than one for agricultural goods, equal to one for manufaucturing goods, and greater than one for services.</p>
<p>We will search for a path along which the real interest rate is constant. We choose this property of balanced growth as our starting point because, unlike other features of a balanced growth path (e.g. the constancy of the growth rate of output), it has clear, tractable implications in multi-sector models.</p>
<p>The share of labour in agriculture declines, while the share in services expands. The rates of change of both factor shares converge to zero in the long run. The two panels of Figure 3, show the evolution of the employment shares and the output share of the three sectors for a numerical example. The fact that the employment shares coincide with the output shares is an implication of the production functions being identical up to a constant of proportionality. As the economy grows the importance of A0 and S0 declines and the economy converges to a standard balanced growth path. This is consistent with the U.S. experience: the sectoral reallocation of labour out of agriculture has been limited since the 1970’s and there has been a slowdown in the expansion of service employment.</p>
<p>There is evidence of sectoral reallocation of employment out of agriculture into services for all growing countries. In contrast, evidence in favour of the Kaldor facts is less compelling for economies other than the U.S. This suggests that perhaps restriction (3.17) holds more closely for the U.S. economy than for other countries.</p>
