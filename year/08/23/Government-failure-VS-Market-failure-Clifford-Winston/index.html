        <p>In theory, government policy seeks to improve microeconomic efficiency by correcting a market failure, defined by Bator (1958) as the failure of a system of price market institutions to stop ‘undesirable’ activities, where the desirability of an activity is evaluated relative to some explicit economic welfare maximization problem. Accordingly, a market failure can be defined as an equilibrium allocation of resources that is not Pareto optimal – the potential causes of which may be market power, natural monopoly, imperfect information, eternalities, or public goods.</p>
<p>Government failure, then, arises when government has created inefficiencies because it should not have intervened in the first place or when it could have solved a given problem or set of problems more efficiently, that is, by generating greater net benefits. In other words, the theoretical benchmark of Pareto optimality could be used to assess government performance just as it is used to assess market performance. Of course, the ideal of a completely efficient market is rarely, if ever, observed in practice. From a policy perspective, market failure should be a matter of concern when market performance significantly deviates from the appropriate efficiency benchmark. Similarly, a government failure should call a government intervention into question when economic welfare is actually reduced or when resources are allocated in a manner that significantly deviates from an appropriate efficiency benchmark.</p>
<p>Economic theory can suggest optimal public policies to correct market failures, but the effect of government’s market failure policies on economic welfare can be assessed only with empirical evidence. For more than a century, the primary market failure policies implemented by government have included antitrust policy and economic regulation to curb market power, so-called social regulatory policies to address imperfect information and externalities, and public financing of socially desirable services that the private sector would not provide.</p>
<p>An additional thirty years of empirical evidence on the efficacy of market failure policies initiated primarily by the federal government, but also by the states, suggests that the welfare cost of government failure may be considerably greater than that of market failure. More specifically, the evidence suggests that policymakers have attempted to correct market failures with policies designed to affect either consumer or firm behavior, or both, or to allocate resources. Some policies have forced the U.S. economy to incur costs in situations where no serious market failure exists, while others, in situations where costly market failure do exist, could have improved resource allocation in a much more efficient manner.</p>
<p>Government failures appear to be explained by the self-correcting nature of some market failures, which makes government intervention unnecessary; by the short-sightedness, inflexibility, and conflicting policies of government agencies; and by political forces that allow well-defined interest groups to influence elected and unelected officials to initiate and maintain inefficient policies that enable the interest groups to accrue economic rents.</p>
<p>The heart of Harberger’s framework is that firms and consumers are self interested agents who respond rationally to public policies. As pointed out by Varian (1993), people may behave irrationally in laboratory studies by violating transitivity, expected utility maximization, and elementary probability, but this behavior is sufficiently rare in actual markets that many economists are willing to advocate only policies that assume people behave rationally. The growing research in behavioral economics may challenge this position by empirically confirming that agents often depart from rational behavior in particular settings, but policies based on such behavior will need to be implemented and assessed before we can conclude that they have merit.</p>
<p>Mergers may harm or benefit consumers. Mergers that enable firms to acquire market power result in higher prices, while mergers that enable firms to realize operational and managerial efficiencies reduce costs and thereby lower prices. In certain markets, a merged entity may stimulate competition and reduce markups over costs. The effectiveness of merger policy therefore depends on how well the antitrust authorities can distinguish procompetitive mergers from anticompetitive ones.</p>
<p>International comparisons have therefore been used to shed some light on the effect of antitrust on deterring monopolization and anticompetitive mergers. Stigler (1966) compared concentration in specific industries in the United States with the same industries in England, which at the time of his study did not have a public policy against concentration of control, and concluded that the Sherman Act has had a very modest effect in reducing U.S. concentration. Eckbo (1992) explored whether the antitrust laws deterred potentially anticompetitive mergers by estimating whether the probability that a horizontal merger was anticompetitive was higher in Canada, where until 1985 mergers were allowed to take place in a legal environment that was effectively unconstrained, than in the United States. Based on this comparison he rejected the hypothesis that the U.S. antitrust laws were deterring anticompetitive mergers.</p>
<p>Kouliavtsev (2004) supported antitrust policy on similar grounds as Baker and cited some evidence that antitrust policy had deterred mergers between 1959 and 1972 that would have been harmful to consumers. But this evidence was based on the assumption that any increase in concentration is a product market increases the price-cost margin. Despite this rather heroic assumption, the fifty-nine horizontal merger cases that provided the basis for Kouliavtsev’s favorable assessment generated gains in allocative efficiency that were smaller than the enforcement costs created by the action. Thus, it is difficult for Kouliavtsev to maintain a favorable assessment of antitrust on cost-benefit grounds.</p>
<p>Competitive markets are an essential step toward efficient resource allocation, but efficiency also requires that buyers and sellers be fully informed and that their actions do not affect the welfare of others. Market participants can adjust their behavior to reduce the social cost of imperfect information and of consumption and production externalities, but information and externality policies may raise social welfare further. In theory, these so-called social regulations seek sumers and producers to take account of the effect of their actions on others’ utility. In practice, the economic policy issue is to determine the most efficient way to compel socially desirable behavior.</p>
<p>As noted in the case of FTC cigarette advertising regulation, some sellers have an incentive to disclose potentially useful information when product quality (safety) varies. Until the mid-1980s, manufactures were prohibited by law from promoting the health content of their food products through advertising. When the prohibition was lifted, the consumption of fiber cereals increased and the consumption of fat and saturated fat decreased (Ippolito and Mathios 1990, 1995). Moreover, advertising was an important source of information that affected consumer behavior.</p>
<p>The FDA also mandates that patients obtain a prescription from a physician before they can purchase certain potentially harmful drugs. On its face, the law discourage self-treatment in favor of professional treatment, which may benefit patients by reducing the expected toxicity cost of drug consumption. But Peltzman (1987) pointed out that the prescription requirement may give patients a false sense of safety and induce them to consume stronger medicine to obtain the benefits of more aggressive treatment. His empirical estimates indicate that the prescription requirement has not reduced but, in fact, may have increased poisonings from overdoses. (It has also failed to reduce infectious disease mortality rates.) Peltzman’s finding illustrates how regulation may create an ‘offset effect’ – that is, consumers are induced to engage in risky behavior such as shifting consumption to more powerful drugs with less certain effects in response to policies that are intended to improve safety.</p>
<p>Individual states have adopted information policies to supplement federal policies. These include prohibiting price advertising that may divert attention from product quality, requiring practitioners in hundreds of occupations to obtain a license that certifies they are competent to perform a particular task, enabling purchasers of new automobiles to obtain a full refund or a replacement vehicle in the event that their automobile is hopelessly defective, and requiring motor vehicles to have annual safety inspections. Empirical evidence indicates that consumers have not been better served by these policies than by federal policies; in fact, in some instances they have been harmed.</p>
<p>Several states prohibit firms from advertising the prices of particular products and services on the grounds that consumers may be induced to pruchase a lower-priced alternative that compromises their health or safety. Yet price advertising may provide information to consumers about product quality and spur competition that weakens the ability of firms to elevate prices and other contents of advertising have arised prices and the variation of prices for eyeglasses (Benham 1972), drugs (Cady 1976), optometric services (Kwoka 1984; Haas-Wilson 1986), and routine legal services (Schroeter, Smith, and Cox 1987) without shielding consumers from products or services that may jeopardize their health.</p>
<p>Occupational licensing is a form of entry regulation that requires individuals to obtain a license if they wish to provide serivices in sectors such as law, dentistry, engineering, and even hairdressing. States use licensing to regulate more than eight hundred occupations, representing nearly 20 percent of the nation’s workers. Licensing may be justified if consumers are likely to be harmed because they are not able or not willing to judge the competence of individuals who provide an important service. But licensing may also have unintended effects such as encouraging do-it-yourself behavior, wasting overtrained talent, and reducing the quantity of available workers. Carroll and Gaston (1981) argued that by reducing the quantity of available workers, occupational licensing may reduce the quantity of services and consumer safety. They presented suggestive evidence that this outcome electricians were associated with more accidental deaths by electric shock from nonindustrial activity), dentists, plumbers, and so on. Kleiner and Kudrle (2000) concluded that occupational licensing did not raise the quality of service consumers received. In the case of dentistry, they found that consumer costs increased in states with more stringent licensing but that dental health did not improve and malpractice suits did not decrease.</p>
<p>I have not found any direct evidence that consumers have been substantially informed, protected, or insured by federal or state information policies. However, an assessment of information policy is not complete without considering whether these policies have benefited consumers by deterring harmful products from being produced and keeping them off the market. As indicated previously, deterrence can have opposing effects: FDA drug evaluations, for example, may have kept harmful drugs off the market and saved lives but may have also delayed potentially helpful drugs from appearing on the market for decades – even beyond the well-documented approval lag. Policy recommendations on how to improve FDA drug evaluations and other information policies would be enriched by research that quantifies and sorts out the benefits and costs of their deterrence effects.</p>
<p>Externalities are positive or negative spillovers caused by an agent’s action that affect the welfare of others. Government can increase efficiency by using pricing or quantity policies to make consumers and firms account for the social costs (or enable them to accrue the social benefits) of their actions. Quantity policies take the form of commands (specific limits are set for a particular externality such as air pollution) or controls (specific technologies are required to abate an externality), or both. Recently policy makers have explored market-oriented approaches, such as emissions trading programs, to reduce externality costs more efficiently.</p>
<p>Some policies have been expensive successes because although their benefits have exceeded costs, the gains could have been achieved at much lower cost. Others have been outright failures because their costs have exceeded benefits. In contrast, market-oriented approaches implemented by the government have shown promise of producing large improvements in social welfare by curbing externalities at lower cost than current policies do.</p>
<p>Consumption externalities arise from a consumer’s use of a product or service that imposes costs on other individuals and the environment. The most notable externalities include automobile emissions, airplane noise, and overconsumption of health care caused by smoking and drinking. Consumption of energy increases the nation’s dependence on foreign oil, which may subject the nation to losses in consumer surplus. Two other major externalities, highway and airport congestion, will be discussed in the context of financing public enterprises.</p>
<p>Policymakers have preferred to address consumption externalities by using commands to influence the behavior of manufacturers rather than by using prices to influence the behavior of consumers. Schultze (1977) questioned whether commands could be an effective policy instrument on the grounds that government’s imagination of how its particular actions can generate social efficiency and its ability to command an appropriate level of performance are not up to the task.</p>
<p>Although it is not clear whether the benefits from reduced emissions exceed the costs, it is clear that a given level of benefits could have been obtained at lower costs. It would have been much more efficient to impose an emissions tax that would have been paid by driver of all (new and used) vehicles, thus reducing emissions and raising fuel economy because more motorists would have been inclined to shift to new vehicles or to drive their old vehicles less. With the development of remote emissions-detection systems, which have been tested in a number of cities since the mid-1990s, it is still possible to implement such a tax. Instead, the EPA has continued to enforce various regulations such as those driven by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 that include standards for cold temperature carbon monoxide, onboard refueling, and vapor recovery among others. The costs and benefits of these policies have not been accessed, but at this point the net benefits from further reductions in vehicle pollution appear to be small.</p>
<p>Beginning in the early 1970s, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) set noise standards for aircraft designs (based on maximum allowable decibel levels) to reduce noise for people who live, work, or pursue recreational activities close to airports. The reduction in noise would be expected to increase property values in the surrounding area. Airlines could either replace their planes that did not meet the noise standards with planes that did or retroft their planes with ‘hush kits’ so that they complied with the standards. Morrison, Winston, and Watson (1999) estimated that the FAA design standards effectively shortened the life of airlines’ capital stock. The increased costs to airlines turned out to exceed the benefits to homeowners, as reflected in higher property values, by $5 billion (present discounted value). An optimal airplane noise tax would have generated only $0.2 billion in net benefits (present value), suggesting that airplane noise has not imposed significant social costs.</p>
<p>The most significant attempt to conserve energy has been the imposition of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. Set in the early 1970s by the U.S. Department of Transportation, CAFE sought to increase the fuel economy of new cars. Its economic effects, however, have been a source of controversy. One view is that it is well-known that consumers value fuel economy, but CAFE has generally failed to influence that two market forces that encourage consumers to purchase fuel-efficient vehicles: gas prices and the profit-maximizing incentives that automakers have to produce such vehicles (Crandall 1992). To the extent that it has increased fuel economy for new vehicles, CAFE has actually encouraged some people to drive more, and by raising vehicle prices the standards have increased emissions because they have encouraged people to retain their used vehicles longer (Kleit 2004; Portney and others 2003).</p>
<p>In 1990 the Environmental Protection Agency set up a trading system in which power companies could buy and sell allowances to emit sulfur dioxide. A company could choose whether it was more cost effective to install scrubbers to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions or to buy allowances from a firm that emits less pollution. Each year the number of these allowances has dropped, with the goal of cutting sulfur dioxide emissions in half by 2012. Tradable permits have generated noticeable welfare improvements over EPA regulations. For example, holding pollution standards constant, sulfur dioxide emissions trading has reduced firms’ adatement costs 25-34 percent compared with command-and-control policies (Schmalensee and others 1998; Carlson and others 2000). Annual savings amount to $700 million - $800 million.</p>
<p>In contrast to the preceding negative externalities, innovative activity by firms may create positive spillovers to their actual or potential competitors. Innovative effort may therefore be suboptimal, creating a form of market failure, because knowledge can be transmitted (either copied or imitated) from its creator to prospective competitors at low cost. The federal government has tried to spur innovation by subsidizing firms and by establishing the patent system so firms and universities can appropriate some of the positive spillovers from their R&amp;D. The subsidies include direct funding, tax credits, and competitions. Some federally funded R&amp;D is contracted out ot universities or companies but undertaken at federal facilities such as Los Alamos National Laboratory or the National Institutions of Health. A patent gives a firm or an individual the exclusive use of an invention for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The patent system seeks to establish property rights in an activity that may otherwise suffer from the market failure of nonexclusivity (an innovation generates positive spillovers to competitors) and nonappropriability (an innovator is unable to fully capture profits from an innovation). An optimal patent policy maximizes the difference between the social benefits from innovations and the sum of the deadweight costs from conferring a monopoly position on the inventor, the costs of preempting other firms’ activities (which may lead to inefficient efforts to get around a patent), and the transactions costs of granting patents, including litigation costs.</p>
<p>A private firm will provide a good or service if it can earn a normal profit. Market failure occurs when a socially desirable service (that is, one whose social benefits exceed social costs) is not privately offered because it is unprofitable. Market failure also occurs when a service is undersupplied because it is a public good and susceptible to the free rider problem. A pure public good – defense and fresh air are probably the only examples – is nonrivalrous (nobody’s consumption lowers anybody else’s benefits) and nonexcludable (it is infeasible to prevent those who do not pay for the good from obtaining benefits). Most publicly supplied services are mixed or ‘impure’ public goods such as roads – consumption is rivalrous during congested periods but exclusion may be difficult.</p>
<p>The government can icrease social welfare by financing socially desirable services, including public goods, which would not be supplied by the private sector. In practice, the government can provide the service or negotiate a contract with a private firm to provide the service. In any case, the government can maximize social welfare by setting efficient user charges for public facilities and by financing investments in the facilities that equate marginal benefits and marginal costs. The facilities requiring the largest investments constitute the nation’s physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Investments in highway durability must trade off the maintenance costs of current pavement against the capital costs of building thicker pavement; optimal investments minimize the investment costs because they have preferred to build thinner pavements to reduce the up-front capital costs. Consequently, all roads, from local thoroughfares to major interstates, experience excessive maintenance costs because they must be repaved sooner than if they were built to optimal (thicker) standards. In addition, the speed and reliability of highway transportation have been adversely affected by the growing share of freeways and arterials in fair or worse condition over the past twenty years.</p>
<p>Small, Winston, and Evans (1989) estimated that replacing gasoline taxes with marginal cost congestion tolls and pavement-wear taxes and building roads to optimal pavement thickness would generate an annual welfare gain of $23.9 billioin. Congestion tolls that vary by time of day and location would reduce delays and make efficient use of scarce road capacity. In addition, efficient highway tolls, which reduce excessive driving during peak periods, would justify a substantial reduction in (inefficient) highway expenditures. Such tolls can also be adjusted to account for possible objections to reducing the welfare of low-income motorists, who place less value on travel time savings than high-income motorists do, without sacrificing much of the gains in efficiency (Small, Winston, and Yan 2006). Marginal cost pavement-wear taxes that are based on a truck’s weight per axle and vary by road type would encourage truckers to shift to vehicles with more axles that do less damage to the roads.</p>
<p>Economic theory identifies many situations where a market failure may arise and suggests how the government could correct the failure and improve economic efficiency. In practice, potential market failures such as market power and imperfect information do not appear to create large efficiency losses to the U.S. economy. However, market failures arising from externalities such as air and water pollution, hazardous wastes, and traffic congestion do impose significant social costs that government policy could reduce efficiently.</p>
<p>What explains the prevalance of government failure when policymakers are presumably trying to correct market failures? In some situations, government failure arises because government intervention is unnecessary – that is, markets can adequately address their possible failures. Consequently, government intervention may prove to be counterproductive because market failure policies are flawed or poorly implemented and because policymakers, regardless of their intentions, are subject to political forces that enable certain interest groups to benefit at the expense of the public. In other situations, government action is called for but is again compromised by agency shortcomings and political forces.</p>
<p>The fundamental underlying problem, as argued by Wolf (1979), is that the existence of government failure suggests the absence of an incentive to reconcile an intervention’s costs and benefits to policymakers with its social costs and benefits. In contrast, it appears that in at least some instances market participants have greater incentives to correct market failures than the government has to correct these failure.</p>
<p>Market forces can even help lower the cost of some externalities. Household’s choices of where to live and work reflect efficient sorting to reduce the costs of congestion, airplane noise, and air pollution. Calfee and Winston (1998) found that commuters with long commutes had lower values of travel time than commuters with shorter commutes, indicating that those commuters who dislike congestion the most reduce its cost by living closer to their workplaces. Morrison, Winston, and Watson (1999) argued that people who have a high tolerance for noise tend to live closer to a flight path and require less compensation, as reflected in lower housing prices, than people who have a low tolerance for noise. Banzhaf and Walsh (2005) reported evidence that whites tended to move out of areas with higher levels of air pollution and were replaced by (poorer) Hispanics. In addition, it has been estimated that black Americans are 79 percent more likely than whites to live in neighborhoods where industrial pollution is suspected of posing the greatest risks to health. Although such sorting has raised concerns of ‘environmental’ justice, it has lowered housing prices for the poor – a benefit that could dissipate if improvements in air quality cause wealthier people to move in and drive up rents for residents who do not own a home.</p>
<p>Some recent work even suggests that markets may exert forces that address multiple sources of potential failure. For example, Antweiler, Copeland, and Taylor (2001) found that freer trade enhanced product market competition and increased a nation’s output, which called for cleaner production methods and helped improve the environment. Specifically, the authors found that sulfur dioxide fell by roughly the same amount in percentage terms that national income rose from more open international markets. Frankel and Rose (2005) reported a similar finding.</p>
<p>Antitrust offers another example of shortsighted policy. After taking several years to resolve a monopolization case, the Justice Department and the FTC often find that the market conditions have changed, but they are unable to anticipate or account for new sources of competition that may eviscerate their reason for bring a case. The antitrust authorities have found it difficult to formulate consent decrees in monopoly and merger cases that benefit consumers in the long run (Crandall and Winston 2003).</p>
<p>When viewed in their totality, market failure policies often conflict: policymakers want to use the antitrust laws to promote domestic competition, but they enact trade policies that are not justified on market failure grounds and disadvantage foreign firms that can compete with U.S. firms; policymakers try to lower the cost of transportation externalities, but they subsidize auto and urban transit; and so on. Generally, policymakers have made little effort to resolve intra- and interagency policy conflicts.</p>
<p>In theory, market failure and social goals policies should complement each other. By enhancing market efficiency and not creating rents that adversely redistribute income, market failure policies should make resources available that could be used for social goals. By redistributing income in an efficient manner, social goals policies should not significantly reduce market efficiency. Given their common problems and the sources of these problems, however, it is not surprising that in practice social goals and market failure policies have conflicted.</p>
<p>Social goals policies have exacerbated market failure by distorting the workings of or impeding improvements in potentially efficient markets. For example, Congress established the E-rate program in 1996 that offered substantial subsidies to public schools and libraries to buy telecommunications services like wiring classrooms and connecting to the Internet. Congress should have considered the most efficient way to finance the subsidy such as a lump-sum tax. Or if public schools were run more efficiently, they may have had sufficient resources to support Internet service. In any case, the subsidies were funded by higher taxes on interstate telephone service, which distorts the workings of an efficient market. Hausman (1998) estimated that the cost of the E-rate program was $2.25 billion a year (not all of which was used for Internet wiring), while the additional cost to raise the requisite funds through taxation was $2.36 billion a year because taxes were imposed on price-elastic services. Thus, an ill-conceived approach to achieve a social goal created a large excess burden that could have been avoided if the goal were accomplished in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>I have discussed how efficient pricing of externalities such as automobile congestion and pollution could reduce the wasteful expenditures associated with current policies while reducing externality costs and improving social welfare. Some policymakers, however, have opposed using prices to address automobile externalities on the grounds that they are likely to harm low income motorists. Thus, efficient reforms of market failure policies are impeded because they appear to conflict with social goals. But the conflict is exaggerated because efficient externality policies would make more resources available for redistribution that may contribute to a more effective welfare policy. For example, some of the revenues generated by efficient congestion tolls could be used to fund transportation vouchers for low income travelers.</p>
<p>How can policy be improved? My first recommendation is that policymakers should pause and truly absorb the fact that government generally cannot be counted on to correct market failure efficiently by itself. Second, it is important for policymakers to acknowledge that the few microeconomic policies that have improved efficiency – which the federal government eventually grew to support – stem from market-oriented appraoches. Moreover, evidence is increasingly suggesting that this approach can be applied to various policy areas. In other cases, our knowledge is insufficient to offer strong policy recommendations.</p>
<p>Although economists have assessed a remarkable range of market failure policies, we have only a very rough idea of the costs and benefits of some of them. As noted, I did not offer strong policy recommendations to improve antitrust and information policy because sufficient evidence regarding their potentially important deterrence effects was not available. In addition, further research is needed to assess the welfare properties of the patent system. Empirical research can help justify and guide privatization experiments to improve on financing of public enterprises. Of course, policymakers may not be immediately receptive to privatization proposals. Nonetheless, it is important for researchers to explore the matter because a crisis, such as intolerable budget deficits, may arise that causes policymakers to consider privatization as a viable policy option.</p>
