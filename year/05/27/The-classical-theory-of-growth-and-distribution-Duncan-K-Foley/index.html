        <p>Economic growth is the cumulative increase in the productive power of human labor effort to meet human needs through changes in the scale and technology of production, the acquisition of skills and knowledge, and the accumulation of means of production such as tools, buildings, and transportation systems.</p>
<p>Economic growth was slow and irregular for most of human existence, up to the emergence of industrial capitalism in Europe starting in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries CE, though the comparison of the Roman or Chinese empires with Stone Age societies shows that substantial economic growth cumulated over many millennia. A dramatic acceleration of world economic growth occurred starting in Europe at the end of the Middle Ages, which has spread to the whole world economy over the last 500 years. Economic growth in this period is based on the organization of a complex division of labor through the exchange of products as commodities bought and sold in monetized markets, the spread of the institution of free wage labor, the establishment of private property rights in means of production including land and natural resources, the emergence of strong national states with effective legal and regulatory systems, and the systematic application of scientific methods to the improvement of productive technology.</p>
<p>It is useful to classify theories of economic growth in terms of the key factor that they identify as limiting or constraining growth. The main candidates for limitations on growth are natural resources (land), human resources (skilled and knowledgeable workers), produced resources (capital), and aggregate monetary demand. The early classical economists emphasized constraints arising naturally, such as the limited availability of fertile land, but their analytical framework envisions growth as a self-regulating activity in the absence of such external constraints arising naturally, limited only by the ability of the economy to manufacture its own resources on an expanded scale. This vision of growth as a kind of bootstrap operation remains vibrant among modern followers of the classical economists To a lesser extent, it also informs the New Endogenous Growth theorists that have broken off from the mainstream neoclassical model. The mainstream neoclassical theory of growth takes human resources as the ultimate constraint on growth. A central tenet of neoclassical growth theory is that capitalist economies fully employ the available labor force in the long run and that the labor force evolves independently of economic growth. The rise of Keynesian economics in the last century introduced a new potential constraint on growth: insufficient growth of aggregate demand. While both the modern classical economists and the neoclassical economists acknowledge this constraint over short time horizons, a substantial school of demand-constrained growth theorists insists that aggregate demand cannot be ignored, even in the long run.</p>
<p>Classical political economy, whose outstanding figures are Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David Richardo, building on the analytical foundations provided by its physiocratic predecessors, developed a comprehensive theory of economic growth within the framework of capitalist economic institutions. The basis of this theory is the organization of production through a division of labor sustained by the exchange of products on markets. Through their ownership of means of production (factories, mills, mines, transport) capitalists organize the productive effort of workers hired on wage contracts. Because wages on average represent a fractional claim on real production (and a smaller money value than the whole value created through production) capitalists can appropriate a profit. Competition among capitalists leads them to re-invest a large fraction of these profits in expanding production, which increases employment, extends the social division of labor, and raise the productive power of labor. This virtuous cycle explains the surge in economic growth associated with industrial capitalism. Individual capitalists also have strong incentives to seek out cost-reducing technical innovations, which secure higher-than-average profits to their first adopters. Thus industrial capitalism institutionalizes the process of technical change, eventually leading to the systematic organization of scientific and engineering effort toward strategic cost-reductions in the economy. High wages tend to channel technical change toward labor-saving innovations which reduce labor costs to capitalists.</p>
<p>In this classical political economy perspective, the growth of human population is a consequence of economic growth. To the extent that the accumulation of capital outpaces labor-saving innovations, the demand for labor grows, leading to higher wages, and hence to an increase in population by reducing infant mortality and attracting migration from less-productive regions and societies. Improvements in nutrition, sanitation, and basic medical care that accompany industrial capitalism also reduce mortality and increase population.</p>
<p>Classical political economy is divided in its projection of the long-run tendencies of economic growth based on capital accumulation. Smith foresaw a gradual rise in wages keeping pace with labor productivity, and hoped that the widening division of labor and technical ingenuity could overcome resource limitations on economic growth indefinitely. Malthus and Ricardo emphasized the limits to growth inherent in limited supplies of land and other natural resources that could eventually choke off economic growth through the operation of diminishing returns that cannot be offset by a widening division of labor and technical innovation. Karl Marx, who based his theory of revolutionary change on the classical political economic analysis of capital accumulation, foresaw limits to capitalist economic growth arising from the social class divisions on which industrial capitalism rested, and leading to a new phase of economic growth organized through socialism.</p>
<p>The central regulating factor in the classical political economists’ theory of economic growth is the division of value created (or value-added) in production between wages and profits. Economic growth paths on which the wage share in value added continually rises or falls are not sustainable. If wages grow less rapidly than labor productivity, the wage share approaches zero, and the social contradictions of capitalism become unmanageable as workers’ contribution to aggregate demand vanishes. If wages grow more rapidly than labor productivity, the wage share approaches unity and the profitability of production vanishes, taking with it the incentives to organize and improve production that drive economic growth.</p>
