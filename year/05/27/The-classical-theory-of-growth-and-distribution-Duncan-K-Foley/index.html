        <p>Economic growth is the cumulative increase in the productive power of human labor effort to meet human needs through changes in the scale and technology of production, the acquisition of skills and knowledge, and the accumulation of means of production such as tools, buildings, and transportation systems.</p>
<p>Economic growth was slow and irregular for most of human existence, up to the emergence of industrial capitalism in Europe starting in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries CE, though the comparison of the Roman or Chinese empires with Stone Age societies shows that substantial economic growth cumulated over many millennia. A dramatic acceleration of world economic growth occurred starting in Europe at the end of the Middle Ages, which has spread to the whole world economy over the last 500 years. Economic growth in this period is based on the organization of a complex division of labor through the exchange of products as commodities bought and sold in monetized markets, the spread of the institution of free wage labor, the establishment of private property rights in means of production including land and natural resources, the emergence of strong national states with effective legal and regulatory systems, and the systematic application of scientific methods to the improvement of productive technology.</p>
<p>It is useful to classify theories of economic growth in terms of the key factor that they identify as limiting or constraining growth. The main candidates for limitations on growth are natural resources (land), human resources (skilled and knowledgeable workers), produced resources (capital), and aggregate monetary demand. The early classical economists emphasized constraints arising naturally, such as the limited availability of fertile land, but their analytical framework envisions growth as a self-regulating activity in the absence of such external constraints arising naturally, limited only by the ability of the economy to manufacture its own resources on an expanded scale. This vision of growth as a kind of bootstrap operation remains vibrant among modern followers of the classical economists To a lesser extent, it also informs the New Endogenous Growth theorists that have broken off from the mainstream neoclassical model. The mainstream neoclassical theory of growth takes human resources as the ultimate constraint on growth. A central tenet of neoclassical growth theory is that capitalist economies fully employ the available labor force in the long run and that the labor force evolves independently of economic growth. The rise of Keynesian economics in the last century introduced a new potential constraint on growth: insufficient growth of aggregate demand. While both the modern classical economists and the neoclassical economists acknowledge this constraint over short time horizons, a substantial school of demand-constrained growth theorists insists that aggregate demand cannot be ignored, even in the long run.</p>
<p>Classical political economy, whose outstanding figures are Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David Richardo, building on the analytical foundations provided by its physiocratic predecessors, developed a comprehensive theory of economic growth within the framework of capitalist economic institutions. The basis of this theory is the organization of production through a division of labor sustained by the exchange of products on markets. Through their ownership of means of production (factories, mills, mines, transport) capitalists organize the productive effort of workers hired on wage contracts. Because wages on average represent a fractional claim on real production (and a smaller money value than the whole value created through production) capitalists can appropriate a profit. Competition among capitalists leads them to re-invest a large fraction of these profits in expanding production, which increases employment, extends the social division of labor, and raise the productive power of labor. This virtuous cycle explains the surge in economic growth associated with industrial capitalism. Individual capitalists also have strong incentives to seek out cost-reducing technical innovations, which secure higher-than-average profits to their first adopters. Thus industrial capitalism institutionalizes the process of technical change, eventually leading to the systematic organization of scientific and engineering effort toward strategic cost-reductions in the economy. High wages tend to channel technical change toward labor-saving innovations which reduce labor costs to capitalists.</p>
<p>In this classical political economy perspective, the growth of human population is a consequence of economic growth. To the extent that the accumulation of capital outpaces labor-saving innovations, the demand for labor grows, leading to higher wages, and hence to an increase in population by reducing infant mortality and attracting migration from less-productive regions and societies. Improvements in nutrition, sanitation, and basic medical care that accompany industrial capitalism also reduce mortality and increase population.</p>
<p>Classical political economy is divided in its projection of the long-run tendencies of economic growth based on capital accumulation. Smith foresaw a gradual rise in wages keeping pace with labor productivity, and hoped that the widening division of labor and technical ingenuity could overcome resource limitations on economic growth indefinitely. Malthus and Ricardo emphasized the limits to growth inherent in limited supplies of land and other natural resources that could eventually choke off economic growth through the operation of diminishing returns that cannot be offset by a widening division of labor and technical innovation. Karl Marx, who based his theory of revolutionary change on the classical political economic analysis of capital accumulation, foresaw limits to capitalist economic growth arising from the social class divisions on which industrial capitalism rested, and leading to a new phase of economic growth organized through socialism.</p>
<p>The central regulating factor in the classical political economists’ theory of economic growth is the division of value created (or value-added) in production between wages and profits. Economic growth paths on which the wage share in value added continually rises or falls are not sustainable. If wages grow less rapidly than labor productivity, the wage share approaches zero, and the social contradictions of capitalism become unmanageable as workers’ contribution to aggregate demand vanishes. If wages grow more rapidly than labor productivity, the wage share approaches unity and the profitability of production vanishes, taking with it the incentives to organize and improve production that drive economic growth.</p>
<p>From the classical perspective, the neoclassical approach to economic growth, either in its original Solow-Swan form, its more modern semi-endogenous form, or even its more radical endogenous form, rests on several questionable preconceptions. First, the neoclassical theories all presume the full employment of labor, and this assumption is supported by their free use of the Cobb-Douglas or similar aggregate production function. With this kind of function, any excess demand or supply of labor can be eliminated by a change in the wage rate that induces firms to change the capital-labor ratio in the direction needed to eliminate the excess demand or supply. For example, an excess supply of labor will depress real wages, incentivize the use of more labor-intensive techniques, and thus soak up the unemployed labor resources. Another way of putting this is that with the Cobb-Douglas assumption, there can never be too little capital to support full employment. While classical models of full employment (Kaldor-Pasinetti) or labor-constrained growth (Goodwin) do exist as we have seen, these are treated more like special, polar cases since the natural presumption in classical theory is that growth is constrained by capital rather than by labor.</p>
<p>Second, the neoclassical theories rely on the marginal productivity theory of income distribution, in which the real wage and profit rate are equal to the marginal products of labor and capital. The Cambridge critique of the aggregate production function attacks both of these foundation stones of neoclassical theory. Since the value of capital per worker does not have a predictable relationship with the real wage in a general disaggregated model of production, the first presumption cannot stand because there may be no mechanism that will guarantee that the capital stock is sufficient to support full employment of a predetermined labor force. Similarly, in a disaggregated model of production, it will generally be impossible to define a marginal product of capital or labor, rendering the marginal productivity theory moot. In the classical theory, capital is treated first and foremost as a social relationship between workers and the owners of productive wealth. From this perspective, the marginal productivity theory obscures or distorts the nature of this relationship by reifying capital, treating it as a productive resource (factor of production) on a par with labor-power or land. Without the crutch provided by the neoclassical production function, there seems to be no resolution to the existence problem posed by Harrod and Domar, except returning to the classical assumption of a class structure of saving rates (which is just another expression of the idea that capital is in essence a social relationship), or to the classical assumption of an endogenously generated effective labor force.</p>
<p>The classical alternative to the neoclassical production function emphasizes the incentives for technical change that are internal to capitalist property relations. The well-established fact that the output elasticity of capital exceeds the profit share by a wide margin, for example, is analytically equivalent to a wage that exceeds the apparent marginal product of labor (Foley and Michl, 1999).<br>(The apparent marginal product is equal to the hypothetical wage that would make a new technique and the old technique it replaces equally profitable.) Under these conditions, capitalists have an incentive to introduce more capital-intensive techniques, even if these reduce capital capital productivity, because they increase the rate of profit for the innovating firm. And the technical dynamism of the capitalist mode of production depends on the increases in real wages that are necessary in order to reproduce the inequality between the wage and the apparent marginal product of labor. In this way, the classical approach emphasizes the role of capital as a social relationship per se in ushering in the modern capitalist era of technical dynamism, unlike neoclassical economists such as Lucas (2002) who emphasize the emergence of intellectual property and individual investments in human capital.</p>
<p>Many modern classical models of growth (Foley, 2003) treat the relationship between wages and technical change as reciprocal. Rising wages not only reflect rising labor productivity, but also induce capitalists to seek more technical improvements that can further raise labor productivity, a hypothesis that has been explored empirically by Marquetti (2004). In this tradition, the neoclassical separation between capital deepening (moving along a production function) and technical change (shifts in the production function) is replaced by the view that capital accumulation and technical change are both aspects of the same dynamic process of development and growth. The hypothesis of induced technical change provides a specific mechanism through which the effective labor force can be considered an endogenous resource that adjusts to the requirements of capital accumulation. Rapid accumulation that depletes the reserves of available labor and bids up wages as a result will create powerful incentives for capitalists to intensify their search for labor-saving technical changes. In this way, the original classical vision of capital accumulation as a self-contained process of development and transformation finds expression in the modern conversation of economic theory.</p>
