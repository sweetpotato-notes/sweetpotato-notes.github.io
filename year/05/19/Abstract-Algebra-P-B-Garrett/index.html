        <p>Theorem (Fermat): Let p be a prime number. Then for any integer x, xp ≡ x (mod p)</p>
<p>A subset H of a group G is said to be a subgroup if, with the same operation and identity element as that used in G, it is a group.</p>
<p>The order of a finite group is the number of elements in it, sometimes written as |G|.</p>
<p>Theorem (Lagrange): Let G be a finite group. Let H be a subgroup of G. Then the order of H divides the order of G.</p>
<p>The index [G : H] of a subgroup H in a group G is the number of disjoint (left or right) cosets of H in G. Thus, Lagrange’s theorem says |G| = [G: H]<em>|H|<br>Proposition: A homomorphic image of a finite cyclic group is finite cyclic.<br>Let G be a group and H a subgroup. The quotient set G/H of G by H is the set of H-cosets G/H = {xH: x∈G}.<br>An isomorphism of a group to itself is an automorphism.<br>A ring R is a set with two operations, + and </em>, and with a special element 0 (additive identity) with most of the usual properties we expect or demand of addition and multiplication:<br>R with its addition and with 0 is an abelian group.<br>The multiplication is associative<br>The multiplication and addition have left and right distributive properties.<br>A commutative ring in which every nonzero element is a unit is a field.<br>The kernel of a ring homomorphism f: R→S is<br>ker f = {r∈R: f(r) = 0}<br>An ideal in R is an additive subgroup I of R such that R*I ⊆ I. That is, I is an R-submodule of R with (left) multiplication.</p>
<p>Proposition: For a commutative ring R with uint, and for an ideal I, the quotient ring R/I is a field if and only if I is a maximal ideal.</p>
<p>A linearly independent set of vectors spanning a subspace W of V is a basis for W. </p>
<p>A field K is algebraically closed if every non-constant polynomial f(x)∈k[x] has at least one root α∈k, that is, f(α)=0<br>Upon division, this algebraic closure property implies that any polynomial in K[x] factors into linear factors in K[x].</p>
<p>Theorem: Any field k has an algebraic closure k<em>, unique up to isomorphism. Any algebraic field extension E of k has at least one injection to k</em> (which restricts to the identity on k).</p>
<p>Proposition: Let (non-constant) M(x) be an irreducible in k[x], with field k. Let I be the ideal generated in k[x] by M(x). Let α be the image of x in the field K = k[x]/I. Then α is a root of the equation M(x) = 0</p>
<p>Proposition: Let P(x) be a polynomial in k[x] for a field k. The equation P(x)=0 has a root α generating a degree d extension K of k if and only if P(x) has a degree d irreducible factor f(x) in k[x].</p>
<p>Corollary: The polynomial xn-1 has no repeated factors in k[x] if the field k has characteristic not dividing n.</p>
<p>Theorem: Let G be a finite subgroup of k* for a field k. Then G is cyclic.</p>
<p>Corollary: For a finite field k, the multiplicative group k* is cyclic.</p>
<p>Given ground field Fq and α in an algebraic extension E of Fq, the images α, αq, αq2… of α under the Frobenius are the (Galois) conjugates of α over Fq. </p>
<p>Proposition: Inside a given algebraic extension E of Fq, the property of being conjugate is an equivalence relation.</p>
<p>Corrollary: Given α in an algebraic field extension E of Fq, the number of distinct conjugates of α over Fq is equal to the degree [Fq(α):Fq]</p>
<p>Two n-by-n matrices A and B with entries in a field k are conjugate if there is an invertible n-by-n matrix g with entries in k such that B = gAg-1<br>Conjugacy is obviously an equivalence relation. The conjugacy classes of n-by-n matrices with entries in k are the corresponding equivalence classes with respect to this equivalence relation.</p>
<p>Theorem (Gauss): Let R be a unique factorization domain. Then the polynomial ring in one variable R[x] is a unique factorization domain.</p>
<p>Corollary: A polynomial ring k[x1, … xn] in a finite number of variables x1, … xn over a field k is a unique factorization domain. (Proof by induction.)</p>
<p>The field of fractions k of an integral domain R is the collection of fractions a/b with a,b∈R and b≠0 and with the usual rules for addition and multiplication.</p>
<p>Theorem: Every permutation is uniquely expressible as a product of disjoint cycles.</p>
<p>Naive definition: A set is an unordered collection of things (not counting multiplicities), its elements.</p>
<p>Corollary: The only order-preserving bijection of a well-ordered set X to itself is the identity map.</p>
<p>A set S is Dedekind infinite if there is an injection from S to a proper subset of S. It is Dedekind finite if it is not Dedekind infinite.</p>
<p>Theorem: Let G be a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group k<em>of a field k. Then G is cyclic.<br>A finite (hence, algebraic) field extension K of k is seperable if the number of (nonzero) field maps σ: K→k</em> of K to an algebraic closure k* of k is equal to the degree [K:k]</p>
<p>A finite field extension K of k is normal if all k-algebra homomorphisms of K into a fixed algebraic closure k* of k have the same image.</p>
<p>A finite field extension K of k is Galois if it is both separable and normal over k. Let K be a finite Galois field extension of k. The Galois group of K over k is the automorphism group G = Gal(K/k) = Aut(K/k)<br>The Galois group of a polynomial f in k[x] over k is the Galois group of the splitting field of f over k.</p>
<p>Theorem: The general  nth degree polynomial equation is not solvable in terms of radicals for n&gt;4.</p>
