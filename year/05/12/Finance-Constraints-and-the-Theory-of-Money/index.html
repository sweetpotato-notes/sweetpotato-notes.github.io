<li><p>Background to the Development of My Thinking on Monetary Theory<br>Although the key Keynesian assertion that savings and investment are automatically equal had been demonstrated by Robertson to be a deceptive fallacy once the proper time sequence of the supply and demand for funds in the money market had been considered, the stock approach to monetary theory seemed to have taken root firmly on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why I Objected to the Stock Approach from the Start<br>It is obvious, therefore, that the transfer by speculators of the excess demand (or excess supply) of funds from the stock market to the money market in the real world does have a tremendous impact on the latter, and the so-called multiplier effect of speculation in the capital market alleged by Kaldor depends very much on how the excess demand (or excess supply) of funds will be financed (or absorbed) in the money market. However, Kaldor, who adopted a flow analysis with respect to the capital market but switched to a Keynesian stock analysis in dealing with the money market, totally overlooked the effects of these transferred flows, because the stock approach has an inherent difficulty in dealing with flows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My First Attempt to Criticize the Liquidity Preference Theory Making Use of Keynes’ Own Post-General Theory Concessionns<br>In that article, I pointed out that liquidity preference theory would become identical with loanable funds theory if (1) the flow elements of the transactions demand for money (Keynes’ finance demand for liquidity) were fully taken into account and if (2) the adjustments in the stock demand to hold money in response to changes in the interest rate and other parameters could be assumed to be instantaneous.<br>Full adjustment of the stock demand for money to the stock supply and to the ruling rate of interest cannot be completed instantaneously. Indeed, in a rapidly changing world, adjustments in stock demand may never be completed before the variables determining that demand, and the stock supply, have changed again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My Encounter with ‘Walras’ Law’<br>Although Patinkin showed that, by what he called Walras’ Law, the loanable funds theory was totally equivalent to the liquidity preference theory, in the very same article he claimed that in a dynamic analysis the loanable funds theory and the liquidity preference theory could, on certain occasions, indicate that the interest rate would move in opposite directions. If, on the basis of Walras’s Law, both the loanable funds theory and the liquidity preference theory are logically correct, how could they yield diametrically opposite results on certain occasions? This puzzling question could not help but convince me further that something must have gone wrong somewhere with this line of argument.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An Enlightenment or a Confusion?<br>In answer to criticism by Ohlin and others, Keynes had admitted in June 1937 that saying that the rate of interest depends on the demand and supply of money ‘may be misleading, because it obscures the answer to the question, demand for money in terms of what?’<br>The correct answer to this question had been suggested by Keynes in the preceding sentence of the same paragraph: ‘the liquidity preference theory of the rate of interest which I have set forth in my General Theory … makes the rate of interest depend on the present supply of money and the demand schedule for a present claim on money in terms of a deferred claim on money.’ That is, the demand for money for the purpose of Keynes’ liquidity preference theory is supposed to consist only of the demand for money in terms of deferred claims on money. The demand for money in terms of other commodities – peanuts, labor services, etc. – are not to be considered at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the monetary theory of Walras is totally different from the theory that Lange and Patinkin developed on the basis of what they called Walras’ Law, surely this is not Walras’ fault but their own. They mistakenly understood the preliminary tatonnement of Walras to refer to transactions in the real world, incorrectly presuming that an individual’s demand for any good must be what he intends to carry away from the market after all the auctioneering and transactions are concluded. They failed to realize that in a money-using economy a major part of the demand for money – i.e., the demand for transactions balances or the demand for finance – arises prior to transactions. Formulating the demand for money in terms of ‘Walras’ Law’ (which is actually no more that the aggregate budget constraint for the preliminary tatonnement) leaves out this transactions demand, while incorrectly including temporary passive receipts of cash as a part of the intentional demand for money.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><p>Challenging an ‘Axiom’ – Sheer Madness?<br>After trying another major American journal without success, I came to the conclusion that Walras’ Law was too firmly entrenched in the mainstream of American economic thinking and that editors of American economics journals were too conformist to allow the publication of my attack on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Confusing Influence of Walras’ Law on the Theory of International Finance<br>Unfortunately, with the sloppy way of thinking induced by Lange’s and Patinkin’s interpretation of Walras’ Law, economists had ceased to ask themselves this question. By assuming that all prices save one are determined in their own markets, and then applying ‘Walras’ Law,’ the potpourri supply and demand for money can be said to determine any price ‘left over,’ be it the price of peanuts or the exchange rate. Thus, we obtain a convenient ‘monetary approach’ as an alternative way to determine the price of any good, whenever we find it difficult to specify its own supply and demand functions.<br>Since I have grave doubts whether the so-called demand for money derived from ‘Walras’ Law’ has any economic meaning, I do not believe that there is any validity to this convenient alternative. Specifically, I do not believe that the demand and supply of money can be used as a short cut to explain the balance of payments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another Attempt to Buck a New Academic Fashion<br>I realized that the academic atmosphere in the United States was still very intolerant towards any critical discussion of Walras’ Law, so that if I tried to publish the paper there, it would most likely receive a series of time-wasting rebuffs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My Skepticism about Portfolio Balance as the Basis for Monetary Theory<br>In the later 1960s, mean-variance portfolio balance theory had come under a different kind of attack by K. Borch and M. Feldstein. This attack had forced Tobin to concede that the theory is applicable only if either the investor’s utility function is quadratic or if the uncertain investment outcomes faced by the investor are normally distributed. However, acknowledging that at least one of these two conditions is necessary for the application of E-S analysis is equivalent to admitting that E-S analysis is practically useless. On the one hand, a quadratic specification is generally recognized as being unsuitable for a utility function: it not only limits its range of applicability, but, even within this range, it has the highly implausible implication of increasing absolute risk-aversion, which both Kenneth Arrow and John Hicks have denounced as absurd. On the other hand, the assumption of a normal distribution for investment outcomes is obviously unrealistic: stocks of limited-liability corporations would surely have a skewed distribution, since their prices cannot possibly fall below zero, and progressive taxation, stop-less hedging, and other factors are all calculated to turn otherwise more or less symmetric distributions into negatively or positively skewed ones. Hence, this concession of Tobin’s amounted to an acknowledgement that the mean-variance analysis of portfolio allocation might as well be abandoned. Tobin, of course, did not intend to go that far, but he offered no way to salvage mean-variance analysis. In fact, he seemed to show little concern for the threat this posed to the validity of the modern theory of money which had been built on the foundation of mean-variance analysis.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Second Attempt to Challenge the Supremacy of the Liquidity Preference Theory<br>I had my own gripes against the Keynesians in that they generally advised developing countries to keep the interest rate low, even if it meant increasing the money supply and imposing bureaucratic credit rationing, thus leading to constant inflationary pressure and wasteful allocation of the very scarce capital available in those countries.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attempt to Formulate a Money Market Model for an Open Economy and to Trace Out the Interrelation between the Money Market and the Foreign Exchange Market<br>It would seem, then, that the monetarists are not, after all, so wrong in saying that if equilibrium in the domestic money market is always achieved instantaneously, then this equilibrium may be said to determine the exchange rate. The demand and supply of money equations in an open economy, however, should include several flow items – exports and imports, as well as domestic investment and consumption – that are usually not included by either liquidity preference theorists or monetarists in their formulation of the stock demand for money.<br>Note too, that equilibrium of the supply and demand for money has already been preempted by liquidity preference theorists to determine the domestic interest rate. As pointed out above, this is legitimate for an open economy only if we assume that the foreign exchange market is already in equilibrium. If after determining the domestic interest rate in this manner, we then try to determine the exchange rate with the same money supply and demand equations, assuming the domestic money market already to be in equilibrium, we would seem to be arguing in circles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inadequacy of the Portfolio Approach as the Basis for a Theory of the Supply of Money<br>My paper, eventually entitled ‘The Diffusion of Reserves and the Money Supply Multiplier,’ proposed, therefore, a flow approach using a modified Markov chain to study the stochastic diffusion of an injection of reserves. It was shown that the traditional timeless version of the money supply multiplier was valid only in the limit as an ergodic state of the diffusion process. It could not be reached instantaneously or even within a very short period of time.<br>The parameters of the traditional money supply multiplier, considered fixed and determined by the public’s desire to hold monetary assets in given fixed proportions, were now shown to be the result not only of portfolio choice decisions but also of expenditure decisions and of various technical or frictional time lags in the transfer of the medium of exchange from one recipient to another. This becomes clear once one recognizes that money in general does not lie about in stagnant pools to be consciously allocated into different portfolios, but rather it exists in a continuously circular flow, in which its various successive temporary resting places are rarely the result of deliberate portfolio decisions. The vast bulk of the total supply of money does not lie in the portfolios of different economic units but is found rather ‘on the wing’ in various channels of circulation. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Confirmation of My Belief in the Superiority of the Wicksell-Robertson Flow Approach Through My Empirical Work at the IMF and My Advisory Work in Taiwan, R.O.C.<br>These encounters with new factual evidence further convinced me that changes in the money supply, and its interest elasticity, had far greater effect on the economy than Keynesian economists realized, and that the so-called inevitable instability associated with flexible exchange rates was usually the result of an inability of the country concerned to control its own money supply.</p>
