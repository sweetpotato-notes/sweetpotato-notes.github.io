        <p>Perhaps the key distinction between this new approach and the earlier tradition was its focus on the dichotomy of ‘tradables’ versus ‘nontradables’ as it dealt with the links between ‘this country’ and the ‘rest of the world’, while the older approach linked country A and country B in more-or-less symmetrical terms, with the exports of country A being the imports of country B. In the theoretical models of the small open economy, the key relative price was Pt/Pn, the ratio of the price of tradables to that of nontradables. This price ratio took center stage in the new analysis, reducing Px/Pm (price level of exports relative to that of imports), known also as the terms of trade, to a more peripheral role. Note that, with given world prices of both exports and imports, Px/Pm plays no role in the adjustment process. In the modern vision, changes in tradables prices are treated as exogenous shocks rather than endogenous adjustments.</p>
<p>Thus, under both fixed and flexible exchange rate systems, a change in the key relative price Pt/Pn is likely to be required as an economy moves to a new equilibrium in the wake of a change in underlying conditions such as resource supplies, international prices, production technologies, taxes, subsidies, etc. This is the basic role of the real exchange rate – it is the key equilibrating variable of a country’s trade and payments. And in carrying out this role, the principle mechanism of adjustment will entail change in Pt/Pn, the relative price of tradables.</p>
<p>I want to call attention at this point to a very common misconception – a confusion between what should be thought of as a ‘real exchange rate adjustment’ on the one hand, and what should be considered a ‘standard inflation’ on the other. In trying to put the distinction in capsule form, I have described a standard inflation process as being typically characterized by large budget deficits, by a tendency to lose international reserves, by a tendency of the exchange rate to (want to) depreciate, and by people betting on a future depreciation. In contrast, in most situation of a price level rise that reflects a real exchange rate adjustment in process, one sees a tendency for international reserves to accumulate, a tendency of the exchange rate to (want to) appreciate, and one observes people betting on a future appreciation of the local currency. This is certainly a notable difference, and only reflects that the two phenomena have very different causes and present policymakers with very different sets of plausible policy alternatives.</p>
<p>Whether the exogenous shock is transitory or permanent, the adjustment process entails:<br>a) the purchase of dollars by the Central Bank,<br>b) the expansion of M0 and, via the money multiplier, of M2,<br>c) generation thereby of excess monetary balances [Ms2/Pd-(M2/Pd)d] in the hands of the public,<br>d) the resulting spending (not all at once) of these excess balances, finally working the excess down to zero,<br>e) a resulting induced new demand for dollars as part of this induced spending goes for tradable goods,<br>f) a tendency, in this adjustment process for the price level of nontradables Pn and hence of the general price level Pd to rise as part of the drawdown of excess monetary balances is spent on nontradables.</p>
<p>But while full offsetting must be regarded as an accident of history, some degree of offsetting must be thought of as being quite likely. Thus, in an empirical analysis of a country’s real exchange rate history, one should be careful not to simply treat a big oil-price rise or a major export boom or a new wave of large capital inflows and/or emigrant remittances as the main disturbances, leaving everything else locked up in the pound of ceteris paribus. No, one must diligently look for signs of other forces that are simultaneously at work. And of these forces, particular attention should be paid to those influencing the time path of (M2/Pd)d – desired real monetary balances.</p>
<p>Again, I cannot get inside the thinking of the PBC authorities, but I believe I understand what must have been their reasoning. When the flood of dollars first began, and they found themselves printing ever more base money even at an accelerating rate, they must certainly have started to worry about the potential inflationary consequences. But as time went on, and on serious rise in the price level occurred, their fears were doubtless eased – certainly the problem of potential inflation would have seemed less urgent. Thoughts of taking sterilizing actions must surely have entered their minds, but why do so while prices still remained stable? The proverbial counsel of ‘don’t rock the boat when things are going well’ would seem particularly apt in their case. Real GDP was growing at around 10% per annum, millions of people were being lifted out of poverty each year, the country’s performance was being applauded all over the world – even being hailed as a miracle. Why put so happy a situation at risk by taking actions which in themselves are sharply deflationary? Particularly so if the inflation that one was thinking of fighting had not actually broken out, and showed little sign of doing so?</p>
<p>I paint this likely scenario in some detail, mainly to show that in order to rationalize the PBC’s actions (or lack of them) in this period, one doesn’t need the slightest element of ‘machinations’ aimed at ‘manipulating the real exchange rate’ so as ‘artificially’ to stimulate the country’s exports. All it takes is a passive attitude, following in the first place the ‘rules of the fixed-exchange-rate game’, and then in the second place being quite content (even though maybe a bit surprised) to find that the economy was growing at a spectacular rate, with little sign that the consequence they most feared (an inflationary outburst) was imminent.</p>
<p>This brings me to a brief note on the nature of real exchange rate adjustment. In general, one can say that in any given moment, there is an equilibrium real exchange rate for a country. Policymakers can modify that equilibrium by changing some real variable (like the Central Bank’s net foreign assets, or the country’s policy concerning import restrictions), but if this is not done, natural forces will work to seek out that equilibrium. What we’ve seen in China is, throughout the period examined, a steady and very heavy inflow of foreign exchange. In the first period, 1996-2003, this disturbance (which by itself would cause a large real exchange rate appreciation) was offset by a huge increase in people’s desired real monetary balances. This was an independent force operating on the RER, not a natural equilibrating response to the huge foreign exchange flow. But fortuitously, in a sense, it succeeded in creating a situation in which the price level could remain virtually constant for several years. (One could also say that in this period the Central Bank expanded its domestic credit (i.e., antisterilized) with the effect of preventing the price level from falling as a result of the massive ‘sterilization by the people’.<br>In the next period, in spite of massive sterilization by the people, the price level threatened to rise (as part of the natural adjustment of the RER to the massive inflow of foreign exchange). Offsetting this the PBC entered with huge bond sales, thus sterilizing close to half of the dollar inflow. This had the effect of containing the price level rise to a mere 7% over three years.</p>
