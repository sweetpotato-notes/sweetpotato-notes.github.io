        <p>While both the Walrasian and Post Walrasian approaches assume rational agents, they differ in the environment in which they model the interaction of those agents. To make its models tractable, the DSGE approach, which is the culmination of the Walrasian modeling tradition, assumes either that agents operate in an information-rich environment or that there is an outside controller who processes all information. The Post Walrasian model, which this collection explores, assumes that agents operate in information-poor environments, without any outside controller.</p>
<p>In the past those who had been brought up in the Walrasian General Equilibrium tradition considered the field of Macroeconomics as essentially corresponding to the problem of aggregation. What meaningful relationships, they asked, among aggregate variables could be established starting from a set of independent utility maximizing individuals. This has not always been the case.<br>Generally, to avoid the aggregation problem, the aggregate data are treated as if they were the result of one individual’s decisions. This, as is well known, is not legitimate from a theoretical point of view. Indeed, in the DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) synthesis the problem is not solved, just treated as if it were solved.</p>
<p>The attempt is heroic, and is only in the beginning stages. So a key question posed throughout the book is: What are the basic ingredients that we require from an alternative view? Given that this question is central, in this foreword I will suggest those themes that I believe should be included. I would include four main themes.<br>First, we would like to model the economy as a system in which there is a direct interaction among individuals. We would like to specify agents who, in a sense, have local as opposed to global knowledge. It may well be the case that they have a limited, even wrong, view of the world.<br>Second, we should require that agents behave in a ‘reasonable’ but not ‘optimal’ way; for example, they may use simple rules and they should not act against their own interests. Moreover, these reasonable agents should evolve in the sense that they learn from previous experience.<br>Third, the system should function over time but without necessarily converging to any particular state. It would be good to have a different notion of equilibrium from the standard one, a notion that corresponds to an economy that is in continual movement.<br>Finally, whatever model we develop should have some testable conclusions; we should be able to imagine some empirical evidence that would lead us to refute our model.</p>
<p>Jordan’s view of the Walrasian system is more abstract and precise. It assumes a central processor of information, which does the calculations, leaving the agents simply to react to the prices they face. For Colander the Walrasian agents incorporate all the processing capabilities required of the system – each is a central processor in its own right. From the Jordan perspective, there is a central processor who does all the work for them.<br>The problem with the informal Walrasian tradition is that it skips over the discussion of how, pricesely, prices are arrived at, or simply assumes ‘price taking’ behavior without answering the question of what ‘price taking’ can mean if all the agents are doing the information processing themselves.<br>The central goal of work within this formal Walrasian framework is to find a set of prices for which aggregate excess demand is zero for all goods. Yet, demand is not even defined unless prices are given. Thus within the strict Arrow-Debreu framework we have to assume that someone other than the agent is setting the prices. This is neither realistic nor philosophically satisfactory but is, I believe, why the Walrasian literature has retained what we can call the Jordan perspective.</p>
<p>So, despite their seeming differences, both perspectives lead to the same place in terms of the need for change and in the direction of future research. They both direct researchers toward constructing a more realistic model of how information is processed by individuals and how they manage to coordinate their different wants.</p>
<p>This recall work by Kalai and Lerner (1993) who showed that, if people are to converge, through learning, on and equilibrium, their initial views of the world have to have something in common. (The condition they use is technical and essentially means that players cannot assign zero probabilities to any of the outcomes of the game that are actually possible.) This brings up a crucial problem when dealing with heterogeneous agents who have, in particular, differing beliefs about the world in which they function. If agents have a totally false idea of reality there is little hope for convergence to an equilibrium of the ‘true’ model.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this I am reiterating many of the points made by Branch. As he shows, heterogeneity of expectations can arise in a misspecified equilibrium situation. Such results are reassuring for those who have been puzzled by the persistent empirical evidence for such heterogeneity of expctations. Perhaps the most important idea here is that we should not regard learning as a way of justifying the static or steady state equilibrium that we are interested in, but we should accept that the learning process itself may lead the economy to have interesting dynamics that do not converge to an equilibrium in the standard sense.</p>
<p>LeBaron’s contribution to the volume captures some of the insights of models of financial markets in which individuals change their forecasts as a result of the opinions of their neighbors or as a result of their own experience. These models demonstrate that the population of traders will likely switch from forecasting in one way to another and that these switches will be reinforced by the feedback into prices. As a result, as the population of traders changes from being dominated by one type of forecast based on fundamentals, for example, to another type based perhaps on extrapolation, bubbles and crashes will occur.</p>
<p>Since there is no equilibrium in the standard sense, the question then is: Can we find some sort of equilibrium notion, or do we have to content ourselves with saying that ‘anything can happen.’ In Follmer, Horst, and Kirman (2005) we suggest such an alternative notion. Although prices are constantly changing and never settle to any steady state, we can show that the time aveages of prices will converge, that the process is ergodic, and that a unique limit price distribution will exist. Thus, despite complicated dynamics, there is some structure in the evolution of prices such that, though they never settle down, it is an appropriate concept of equilibrium. Why is this interesting? Because I think this gives us an idea of equilibrium that is not Walrasian in the usual sense, but is specifiable and consistent with the empirical evidence because it also allows us to explain a number of the stylized facts in financial time series such as ‘fat tails’ and ‘long memory.’</p>
<p>Dynamics are important, and assuming away the possibilities of internally generated bubbles in one’s models, as is done by most DSGE models, will give us little insight into how to deal with such bubbles should they actually occur.</p>
<p>These new tools means that the Post Walrasian approach<br>(1) takes more seriously the problem of multiple equilibria and equilibrium selection mechanisms;<br>(2) takes model uncertainty much more into accounts;<br>(3) takes seriously the problem of agent heterogeneity and interdependence;<br>(4) takes the problem of agent learning much more seriously;<br>(5) is more driven by empirical regularities than theory in guiding is policies;<br>(6) is more likely to use general-to-specific cointegrated VAR statistical analysis loosely limited by a broad sense of theory rather than to use theory limited by empirical observations;<br>(7) is far less certain about policy, seeing policy as a way of helping coordinate agents by giving them a focal point.</p>
<p>The terms New Keynesian, New Classical, and even real business cycle analysis are seldom used any more; instead there is a growing consensus that a new synthesis has been reached (Woodford, 1999; Blanchard, 2000a). This new synthesis  is called the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) synthesis and it is providing the structure of much modern theoretical macroeconomic research and macroeconomic thinking about policy. Essentially, the New Synthesis sees the macroeconomic problem as a gigantic dynamic general equilibrium optimal control problem, and looks at the full optimization of individuals and firms, arriving at a solution by using rational expectations and model consistency assumptions.</p>
<p>In many ways, the Post Walrasian research program is the same research program that Classical economists before Keynes were struggling with. The Keynesian revolution was a revolution to deal with the macropuzzle with the available tools. Keynes had a sense that the Classical assumption of a unique stationary state for an economy with true uncertainty was wrong, and he set out to propose an alternative, more general theory, that had multiple attractors, rather than a unique equilibrium. His revolution failed not because its vision was wrong, but because the tools were inadequate to the task at hand. Given the tools available, the Walrasian approach was forced to narrow the puzzle down to one that was manageable, or at least became manageable after 50 years of developments in analytic, computing, and statistical developments.<br>Now that the Walrasian question has been answered with the New Synthesis, the question we must now deal with is: how much insight does that New Synthesis provide to the broader question of how reasonable agents operate in information poor environments? The Post Walrasian work being described in the volume is the beginning of a formal attempt to deal with this question, and for that reason, one can see it as a return to the broader Classical question and the beginning of a true ‘New’ Classical revolution. </p>
<p>Post Walrasians take a different tack, emphasizing that the future is not a knowable fact, not even in principle, and not even in probabilistic terms. Theories of asset pricing that posit known probabilities abstract from this feature of the world, and so do the various versions of the DSGE model of the macroeconomy. As such, they offer nother more than one possible story about one possible future. The important thing is that, to the extent that people believe this story, or any other story, they adjust their current behavior accordingly. In this sense, one of the most important lessons of the DSGE model is that economic theories themselves are the significant knowable facts in the modern world. Post Walrasians ask what happens in a world where a large number of people interact, each one behaving according to their own theory about the future.</p>
<p>The DSGE model that dominates standard macroeconomic discourse is of course one possible candidate story about one possible future, but it is clearly a very special case. Not only does it assume that everyone somehow converges on the same theory of the world, but the theory on which they are supposed to converge treats all uncertainty as merely exogenous risk with known probabilities. It is a theory that succeeds in taming the uncertain future merely by assuming that uncertainty is already tame. That’s fine, of course, as an abstraction and a first step. The justification, fair enough, is that we must walk before we can run. But one major drawback, as we have seen, is the lack of room for a theory of economic policy, since in this special case individual rationality is enough to achieve social rationality and there is nothing much left for collective intervention to add.</p>
<p>Post Walrasian work represents an attempt to broaden out from the DSGE model in order to deal with the deeper uncertainty that the DSGE approach assumes away. In a world of uncertainty, rational choice no longer provides much analytical traction, so Post Walrasian work treats agents as dealing with information poor environments, and having limited information processing capabilities. Nevertheless, the general idea that behavior should be model-consistent remains attractive. Model consistency replaces rational expectations as the closure of Post Walrasian models.</p>
