        <p>In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element and that satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility.</p>
<p>A group is a set, G, together with an operation • (called the group law of G) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element, denoted a • b or ab. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, (G, •), must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms:<br>Closure<br>For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a • b, is also in G.<br>Associativity<br>For all a, b and c in G, (a • b) • c = a • (b • c).<br>Identity element<br>There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a in G, the equation e • a = a • e = a holds. Such an element is unique (see below), and thus one speaks of the identity element.<br>Inverse element<br>For each a in G, there exists an element b in G, commonly denoted a−1 (or −a, if the operation is denoted “+”), such that a • b = b • a = e, where e is the identity element.<br>A group is a set, G, together with an operation • (called the group law of G) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element, denoted a • b or ab. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, (G, •), must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms:</p>
<p>Uniqueness of identity element and inverses</p>
<p>Definition<br>If a, b and c are the rows of a square matrix A, then the determinant of A is a•(b×c)<br>In V3(R), the absolute value of the determinant a•(b×c) is the volume of the parallelepiped with three concurrent edges through the originn and the points a, b and c.</p>
<p>Two matrices A and B are said to be similar when there exists a matrix M such that B=M−1AM<br>Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues, the same characteristic equation and the same determinant.</p>
<p>Two elements x and y of a group G are said to be conjugate when there exists a g∈G such that x=g−1yg</p>
<p>Conjugacy is an equivalence relation on a group</p>
<p>Each conjugacy class of Sn contains all the permutations with a given cycle structure.</p>
<p>x→g−1yg maps the pure quaternions onto themselves and so acts as a linear transformation and in fact an isometry on this 3-dimensional space.</p>
<p>All line and ratio preserving transformations of Vn(F) are affine transformations.</p>
<p>The product set S×T is the set of all ordered pairs (s,t) of elments s∈S and t∈T.</p>
<p>A general relation between S and T is any subset of S×T. </p>
<p>A subset R of S×S is called an equivalance relation on S if:</p>
<p>1) reflexivity, sRs always holds</p>
<p>2) symmetry, sRt implies tRs</p>
<p>3) transitivity, sRt and tRu imply sRu</p>
<p>A partition of S is a representation of S as the union of nonempty, mutually disjoint subsets of S.</p>
<p>A mapping, or function, from S into T is a subset R of S×T such that for any s∈S, there is exactly one pair in R having s as its first member.</p>
<p>Two algebraic systems S and T are called isomorphic if there is a 1-1 correspondence between the elements, relations, and operations of S and T such that under the correspondence of elements all relations and operations are preserved. </p>
<p>If we have the structures S and T such that for each relation and operation in S there is a corresponding relation or operation in T (but not necessarily conversely), and we have a mapping α from S into T which preserves the relations and operations of S, then we say that α is a homomorphism of S into T.</p>
<p>A (multiplicative) group G is cyclic if there is an element a∈G such that for any b∈G there is some integer j (positive, negative, or zero) such that b=aj such an element a is called a generator of the cyclic group, and we write G=(a)</p>
<p>A permutation, π, of the set S is a 1-1 mapping of S onto S.</p>
<p>Any permutation π of a set of n symbols can be expressed as a product of disjoint cycles (i.e. cycles no two of which alter any common symbol).</p>
<p>The order of a group G is the number n of elements in the group, if this number is finite. Otherwise, G is said to be of infinite order.</p>
<p>(Cayley) Every group G is isomorphic to a permutation group of its own elements.</p>
<p>The set of all automorphisms of a group G is a group.</p>
<p>A nonempty subset H of the group G is a subgroup of G iff ab−1∈H for all a,b ∈H</p>
<p>If Xπ=X, then π is an even permutation, if Xπ=-X, then  is an odd permutation.</p>
<p>If H is a subgroup of G, then H defines a partition of G (and an equivalence relation on the set G).</p>
<p>If H is a subgroup of order m in a group G of order n, then m divides n, and every coset aH, or Ha, has the same number of elements as H.</p>
<p>The number of cosets of the subgroup H in G (including the identity coset eH=He=H) is the index of H in G, written [G:H]. </p>
<p>(Theorem of Lagrange) The order of a finite group G is the product of the order of any subgroup H and the index of H in G.</p>
<p>The subgroup H of G is normal in G if  aha−1∈H for all  a∈G and all h∈H (or, equivalently, if  b−1hb∈H for all b∈G, h∈H). The group G is simple if its only normal subgroups are G itself and the identity subgroup E=(e).</p>
<p>For any subgroup H of G and any element a of G, the set  aHa−1={aha−1:h∈H} is a subgroup of G isomorphic to H, H≈aHa−1</p>
<p>For H a subgroup of G and a∈G, aHa−1 is called a conjugate subgroup of H; the isomorphic mapping of H, h→aha−1, is called conjugation by a; and the elements h and aha−1 are said to be conjugate.</p>
<p>The subgroup H of G is normal iff H is equal to all its conjugates (i.e. H is self-conjugate) and iff H is invariant (as a group, not elementwise) under all the inner automorphisms of G.</p>
<p>The subgroup H of G is normal in G iff the left cost aH is also the right coset Ha for every a∈G.</p>
<p>If H is a normal subgroup of G, G/H will denote the set of all cosets of H.</p>
<p>For subgroups H and K of G, the set HK is a subgroup of G iff HK=KH. This condition is satisfied if either H or K is normal in G, and if both H and K are normal in G, then so is HK.</p>
<p>If K is a normal subgroup of G, then G/K is also a group with respect to the operation (aK)(bK)=(ab)K</p>
<p>The kernel of the homomorphism a:G→H of a group G into the group H is the set </p>
<p>K={g:g∈G, ga=ea=e’, the identity of H}.</p>
<p>Thus the kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements having the identity element as image.</p>
<p>If θ contains all automorphisms of G, then a composition series is called a characteristic series, and if θ is the set of all endomorphisms of G, then a composition series is called a fully invariant series.</p>
<p>(Schreier Refinement Theorem) Two given subinvariant series of the θ-group G have refinements which are isomorphic.</p>
<p>(Jordan-Holder theorem) Any two composition series of an θ-group G are isomorphic.</p>
<p>Every finite θ-group G has a composition series.</p>
<p>If G is an Abelian group and T its torsion subgroup, then G/T is torsion-free.</p>
<p>An Abelian torsion group G is isomorphic to the weak direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.</p>
<p>If the order of  a finite group G is divisible by a prime p, then G contains an element of order p.</p>
<p>Every finite p-group has a composition series in which the factor groups are Abelian.</p>
