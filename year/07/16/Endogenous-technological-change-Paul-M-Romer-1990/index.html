        <p>Growth in this model is driven by technological change that arises from intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents. The distinguishing feature of the technology as an input is that it is neither a conventional good nor a public good; it is a non-rival, partially excludable good. Because of the noncanvexity introduced by a nonrival good, price-taking competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is one with monopolistic competition. The main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human capital is devoted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will increase growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth.</p>
<p>The argument presented in this paper is based on three premises. The first is that technological change – improvement in the instructions for mixing together raw materials – lies at the heart of economic growth. As a result, the model presented here resembles the Solow (1956) model with technological change. Technological change provides the incentive for continued capital accumulation, and together, capital accumulation and technological change account for much of the increase in output per hour worked.</p>
<p>The second premise is that technological change arises in large part because of intentional actions taken by people who respond to market incentives. Thus the model is one of endogenous rather than exogenous technological change. This does not mean that everyone who contributes to technological change is motivated by market incentives. An academic scientist who is supported by government grants may be totally insulated from them. The premise here is that market incentives nonetheless play an essential role in the process whereby new knowledge is translated into goods with practical value. Our initial understanding of electromagnetism arose from research conducted in academic institutions, but magnetic tape and home videocassette recorders resulted from attempts by private firms to earn a profit.</p>
<p>The third and most fundamental premise is that instructions for working with raw materials are inherently different from other economic goods. Once the cost of creating a new set of instructions has been incurred, the instructions can be used over and over again at no additional cost. Developing new and better instructions is equivalent to inurring a fixed cost. This property is taken to be the defining characteristic of technology.</p>
<p>Economists studying public finance have identified two fundamental attributes of any economic good: the degree to which it is rivalrous and the degree to which it is excludable (Corners and Sandler 1986). Rivalry is a purely technological attribute. A purely rival good has the property that its use by one firm or person precludes its use by another; a purely nonrival good has the property that its use by one firm or person in no way limits its use by another. Excludability is a function of both the technology and the legal system. A good is excludable if the owner can prevent others from using it. A good such as the code for a computer program can be made excludable by means of a legal system that prohibits copying or by means of encryption and copy protection schemes.</p>
<p>Conventional economic goods are both rivalrous and excludable. They are privately provided and can be traded in competittive markets. By definition, public goods are both nonrival and nonexcludable. Because they are nonexcludable, they can not be privately provided or traded in markets. Public goods can be introduced into a model of price-taking behavior by assuming the existence of a government that can levy taxes. Basic scientific research is an example of a public good that could be provided in this way and that is relevant for modeling growth.</p>
<p>In this sense, a design differs in a crucial way from a piece of human capital such as the ability to add. The design is nonrival but the ability to add is not. The difference arises because the ability to add is inherently tied to a physical object (a human body) whereas the design is not. The ability to add is rivalrous because the person who possesses this ability cannot be in more than one place at the same time; nor can this person solve many problems at once. As noted above, rivalry leads to a presumption that human capital is also excludable. Thus human capital can be privately provided and traded in competitive markets. In contrast, the design is nonrival because it is independent of any physical object. It can be copied and used in as many different activities as desired.</p>
<p>Like any scientific concept, nonrivalry is an idealization. It is sometimes observed that a design cannot be a nonrival good because it is itself tied to the physical piece of paper or the physical computer disk on which it is stored. What is unambiguously true about a design is that the cost of replicating it with a drafter, a photocopier, or a disk drive is trivial compared to the cost of creating the design in the first place. This is not true of the ability to add. Training the second person to add is as costly as training the first. For simplicity, the arguments here will treat designs as idealized goods that are not tied to any physical good and can be costlessly replicated, but nothing hinges on whether this is literally true or merely close to being true.</p>
<p>Linearity in A is what makes unbounded growth possible, and in this sense, unbounded growth is more like an assumption than a result of the model. In what follows, it will become clear that the marginal product of human capital Hy employed in the manufacturing sector grows in proportion to A. If A were replaced in equation (3) by some concave function of A – that is, if the marginal productivity of human capital in the research sector does not continue to grow in proportion to A – human capital employed in research would shift out of research and into manufacturing as A becomes larger. This will cause the rate of growth to slow down. Whether opportunities in research are actually petering out, or will eventually do so, is an empirical question that this kind of theory cannot resolve. The specification here, in which unbounded growth at a constant rate is feasible, was chosen because there is no evidence from recent history to support the belief that opportunities for research are diminishing. Moreover, linearity in A is convenient analytically, and assumptions about what will happen in the far future for values of A that are very large relative to the current level have very little effect on the question of interest: How do other variables in the model affect the rate of growth of A?</p>
<p>The crucial feature of the specification used here is that knowledge enters into production in two distinct ways. A new design enables the production of a new good that can be used to produce output. A new design also increases the total stock of knowledge and thereby increases the productivity of human capital in the research sector. The owner of a design has property rights over its use in the production of a new producer durable but not over its use in research. If an inventor has a patented design for widgets, no one can make or sell widgets without the agreement of the inventor. On the other hand, other inventors are free to spend time studying the patent application for the widget and learn knowledge that helps in the design of a wodget. The inventor of the widget has no ability to stop the inventor of a wodget from learning from the design of a widget. This means that the benefits from the first productive role for a design are completely excludable, whereas the benefits from the second are completely non-excludable. In an overall sense, this means that the nonrival design inputs are partially excludable.</p>
<p>An equilibrium for this model will be paths for prices and quantities such that (i) consumers make savings and consumption decisions taking interest rates as given; (ii) holders of human capital decide whether to work in the research sector or the manufcturing sector taking as given the stock of total knowledge A, the price of designs Pa, and the wage rate in the manufacturing sector Wa; (iii) final-goods producers choose labor, human capital, and a list of differentiated durables taking prices as given; (iv) each firm that owns a design and manufactures a producer durable maximizes profit taking as given the interest rate and the downward-sloping demand curve it faces, and setting prices to maximize profits; (v) firms contemplating entry into the business of producing a durabe take prices for designs as given; and (vi) the supply of each good is equal to the demand.</p>
<p>Both spillovers and price setting seem essential to capturing the features of knowledge in a model of growth. There is little doubt that much of the value to society of any given innovation or discovery is not captured by the inventor, and any model that missed these spillovers would miss important elements of the growth process. Yet it is still the case that private, profit-maximizing agents make investments in the creation of new knowledge and that they earn a return on these investments by charging a price for the resulting goods that is greater than the marginal cost of producing the goods.</p>
<p>The model presented here shows that when the decision to invest in physical capital is uncoupled from the decision to invest in research, the effects of a subsidy to physical capital are quite different from the effects of a reduction in the market interest rate. If the fundamental policy problem is that we have too many lawyers and MBAs and not enough engineers, a subsidy to physical capital accumulation is a weak, and possibly counterproductive, policy response.</p>
<p>The most direct test of this implication of the model would come from a controlled experiment in which the level of research activity was monitored both before and after a country was opened to trade with the rest of the world. Sokoloff (1988) reports historical data on a natural experiment that comes close to this test. He finds cross sectional variation that supports the model: counties in the United States in the early nineteenth century that had access to navigable waterways had higher rates of patenting than counties that did not. More convincingly, he shows that over time, the introduction of water transportation (because of either the construction of a new canal or the dredging of a river) was followed by a sharp increase in the rate of patenting in counties adjacent to the waterway.</p>
