        <p>One of the most notable events of the world economy over the past twenty years has been the phenomenal growth in the number of international economic integration agreements (EIAs). EIAs are treaties between economic units – in the case of international EIAs, between nations – to reduce policy controlled barriers to the flow of goods, services, capital, labor, etc.</p>
<p>The term ‘competitive liberalization’ essentially captures that governments are acting in a compeititive manner – much like firms in industries with large numbers of suppliers – to set policy-based trade and investment barriers that benefit (perhaps, maximize) the economic welfare of their nations’ households and the economic profits of their nations’ firms. Bergsten’s thesis is best captured in the following excerpt:<br>it is first essential to understand why so many countries, in so many different parts of the world, with such different economic systems, at such different stages of development, have all headed in the same direction. There are of course different national circumstances which explain the detailed strategies and timing of the individual initiatives. The overarching force, however, has been process of competitive liberalization. (1996, p.2)</p>
<p>Most trade economists share a view that openness to trade will enhance standards of living by enabling countries to benefit from increased economic specialization. If the trade is between two different economies in terms of productivities or relative factor endowments, trade will enhance traditional comparative advantages, and both countries’ representative consumers can benefit from increased specialization (albeit with consequences for the distribution of incomes within economies, i.e., the Stolper-Samuelson theorem). If trade is between two similar economies in terms of productivities and relative factor endowments, countries can still gain potentially from economies of scale in production and increased varieties in consumption (or in intermediates for production); this is intra-industry trade, which is at the core of the ‘New Trade Theory,’ cf., Helpman and Krugman (1985).</p>
<p>Briefly, some of the earlier literature on the effect of trade on growth found that trade had an economically and statistically significant impact on economic growth (more accurately, an impact on the level of per capita income, not the growth rate thereof), cf., Michaely (1977), Dollar (1992), and Edwards (1993). Owing to the long-standing concern that trade and economic activity are both endogenous, one of the more prominent articles to date, by Frankel and Romer (1999), constructed an instrumental variable for trade – using a gravity equation based upon populations and numerous (exogenous) geography variables to predict trade levels. One of the important conclusions from Frankel and Romer (1999) is that OLS coefficient estimates of trade on growth do not have significant endogeneity bias upward; the use of instrumental variables confirmed in their study a sizeable impact of trade on growth (although there is no explicit role for trade policy’s effect on trade).</p>
<p>However, Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000) and Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi (2004) have criticized the conclusions of such work, arguing that – once the role of institutions is accounted for properly – the effect of trade on growth is insignificant. Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi (2004) provide empirical evidence that institutions ‘trump’ the importance of trade (and of geography) as the key ‘deep determinant’ of economic growth.</p>
<p>To illustrate our approach, we simply regressed the Time-to-EIA-Date-of-Entry on a constant and the Predicted Probability of having and EIA (from Baier and Bergstrand, 2004; each prediction determined by time-invariant variables or economic conditions in 1960); the expected coefficient sign was negative. The Predicted Probability had a statistically significant negative coefficient estimate, with a t-statistic of 9.77. The R square of the regression was 41 percent. Moreover, the coefficient estimate had a straightforward economic interpretation. For every 1 percentage point increase in the probability of having and EIA (based upon time-invariant variables and initial GDP conditions in 1960), the time to an EIA’s date of entry fell by 4 months.</p>
