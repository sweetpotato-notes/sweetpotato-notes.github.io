        <p>Two three and multisector models have a well established tradition in economic theory and they have been repeatedly used to deal with problems pertaining to the theory of value, relative prices, distribution and growth, short and long run consequences of exogenous shocks, interindustrial coordination and competition problems.</p>
<p>Dynamic multisector models may be grouped into five classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leotief’s dynamic model and its generalizations;</li>
<li>multisector noe-classical models;</li>
<li>classical-Marxian dynamic models of gravitation;</li>
<li>traverse models;</li>
<li>structural theories of the business cycles.</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) Leotief’s dynamic model and its generalizations;<br>Input-output dynamic models describe the evolution of prices and quantities according to a dynamical process that is characterized by the following set of assumptions: fixed coefficients production function, full utilization of the productive capacity of each sector within each period; a uniform rate of profit across sectors in each period and not asymptotically as the result of capital mobility across sectors as in the classical and Marxian analysis of gravitation, i.e. of the stability of long-term equilibrium.</p>
<p>(2) multisector noe-classical models;<br>Neo-classical multisector dynamic models describe the dynamics of the capitalist economy as a sequence of temporary equilibria. This type of models is meant mainly to generalize the Meade-Samuelson-Solow-Swan parables of aggregate models of growth lead by accumulation of capital and increasing population to the more realistic case of a multi-sector, multi-commodity world. These models make explicit the basic structure of growth theory; from the neo-classical (i.e. marginalist) point of view growth theory is considered as the extension of the theory of general economic equilibrium to the intertemporal context.</p>
<p>(3) classical-Marxian dynamic models of gravitation;<br>Many economists have been aware since a long time that the assumption that all markets are in equilibrium at every time may be unrealistic. Thus in the last two decades we have witnessed a renewed interest in the classical analysis of competition for a capitalist economy. According to the classical analysis of competition two mechanisms are at work in the capitalist economy.<br>(a) Capital is allocated to the productive sectors according to profit rate differentials (law of profitability)<br>(b) Prices of commodities change according to disequilibrium on the market (law of demand and supply)</p>
<p>(4) traverse models;<br>Traverse models are concerned with the problem of transition between long period positions of the economy as a consequence of structual change. The traverse analysis developed by J. Hicks within a neo-Austrian framework and the model of instrumental analysis of A. Lowe falls within this category.<br>These models and the term ‘traverse’ itself were introduced by Hicks to highlight the role of technical progress in the growth process of an economy and its structural change. Hick’s model is a dynamic equilibrium model, but not steady state equilibrium one; it assumes that the productive capacity is always fully exploited and describes the production process of a final good in terms of a vertically integrated sector.</p>
<p>(5) structural theories of the business cycles.<br>Among these theories we want to cite and briefly summarize those due to Tugan-Baranowski, Fanno, and Hicks. In all of them the overproduction, caused by the lag separating the decision to invest in order to increase the output and the actual beginning of the productive life of new plants, appears as an excess supply of consumption goods, that leads to increasing involuntary stockpiling. We cite also Aftalion’s theory; in it Say’s law is assumed to hold in the aggregate, thus the overproduction causes an immediate fall of prices, that jeopardizes the profitability of firms cramping the capital accumulation process.</p>
<p>We start describing the technology. We consider a Leontief-type fixed coefficients production function with two complementary production factors: labor and fixed capital. Any concrete unit of capital has a given output capacity and requires a given complement of labor, i.e. there is no substitutability between labor and capital.</p>
<p>The aim of this assumption is two fold. First we want to throw some light on possible bottlenecks in the growth path and in the capital accumulation process: a production function allowing for large substitutability might somehow hide problems arising from scarcities of some production factors.</p>
<p>Second the fixed coefficients production function allows a very simple representation of any type of technical progress: for instance, an increase of the marginal productivity of labor in the consumption goods sector is simply represented by an decrease of the corresponding coefficient l1 of the Leontief production function. Labor is perfectly elastic and the real wage rate is constant throughout the analysis.</p>
<p>Investment decisions of firms play a central role in the dynamic of a capitalist economy. Two factors have to be considered: allocation of capital to the firms by capitalists, and the actual use of the sum so determined to the firms by capitalists, and the actual use of the sum so determined by entrepreneurs, who can either decide to use only a part of it or to resort to the credit in order to achieve a higher level of investment.</p>
