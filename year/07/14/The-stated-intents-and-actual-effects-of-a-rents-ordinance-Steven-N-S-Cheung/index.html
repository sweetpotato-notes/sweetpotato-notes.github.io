        <p>History must be replete with instances where the stated intentions of legislative actions have diverged from the actual effects. However, for two reasons it is difficult to demonstrate such variance empirically in actual case studies. For one thing, legislators often tend to express their intentions in such vague terms as ‘to improve welfare.’ How can one measure by any commonly accepted criteria how well the observable effects attributable to a given piece of legislation fulfill such an intention? Second, before observed effects can even be attributed to a given enactment, it is imperative that implications be derived which can be confirmed or falsified by facts; and this, in turn, demands sufficient information on the relevant constraints.</p>
<p>The rent control in Hong Kong enacted under the Rents Ordinance of 1921 presents an exceptionally useful case. the legislative intents could not have been stated more clearly: rent control was imposed to keep a roof over the heads of the sitting tenants and to encourage the construction of nw buildings on vacant lands. And although most of the records were destroyed by the Japanese occupation of the colony during World War II, adequate information is still available to allow derivation of some crucial implications of the control.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the view expressed by the Council – that rent control will encourage housing development in the uncontrolled sector – was a popular view at that time. Certainly it has come into vogue in the postwar period, supported by the more sophisticated arguments of economists typified by the summary statement of Lionel Needleman: If the price and availability of only part of the housing supply is controlled, then in a period of housing shortage, the excess demand will be channelled into the uncontrolled sector and in that sector, rents and prices will be much higher than if control had never been imposed.</p>
<p>This ‘spillover’ hypothesis, like any of a large number of hypotheses pertaining to price control, is plausible, because it may be make consistent with economic theory simply by asserting additional constraints to the control in price. The same arbitrary assertion will yield whatever results are desired in any other context where price is controlled. In such cases, however, the predictive power of economic theory flounders if it turns out that the actual constraints differ in essential aspects from those imagined or asserted. It is therefore futile to make any general statement on what particular effect a control in price must bring. Rather, to derive implications to be tested against observations, it is essential to investigate the real-world constraints applicable to the control in question.</p>
<p>Lacking the right of arbitrary eviction, the landlord now had only two options to evict the tenants: he could claim the tenement for his own occupancy or he could evict for reconstruction. The first option, however, was feasible only under rare circumstances. As cited earlier, similar accommodations – ‘reasonalby equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects’ – had to be found for the tenants, and that was difficult under rent control. Furthermore, any mala fide repossession for the landlord’s own occupancy might prove very costly, since compensation for the tenant might subsequently by demanded by the court. Thus, in general, reconstruction was the only alternative to eviction or the threat of eviction; under this second option, the Rents Ordinance required no compensation by the landlord to the tenants.</p>
<p>In a world where information is costly, many decisions will inevitably be based on inadequate knowledge and will prove faulty. Any decision maker will therefore seek ways to reduce the frequency and magnitude of his errors. In the absence of private property rights constraining legislative decision making, we naturally expect that behavior of legislators towards the avoidance of errors to be different than that of individuals in the market place. But whereas the constraints governing individual decisions in the market are familiar to us, those governing legislative decisions are not and may vary from place to place. We are therefore unable to conclude on theoretical grounds whether legislative decisions are more error prone. Certainly such a conclusion is not reached in this paper.</p>
