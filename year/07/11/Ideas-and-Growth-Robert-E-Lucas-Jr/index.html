        <p>What is it about modern capitalist economies that allows them, in contrast to all earlier societies, to generate sustained growth in productivity and living standards? It is widely agreed that the productivity growth of the industrialized economies is mainly an ongoing intellectual achievement, a sustained flow of new ideas. Are these ideas the achievements of a few geniuses, Newton, Beethoven and a handful of others, viewed as external to the activities of ordinary people? Are they the product of a specialized research sector, engaged in the invention of patent-protected processes over which they have monopoly rights? Both images are based on important features of reality and both have inspired interesting growth theories, but neither seems to me central. What is central, I believe, is the fact that the industrial revolution involved the emergence (or rapid expansion) of a class of educated people, thousands – now many millions – of people who spend entire careers exchanging ideas, work-related problems, generating new knowledge.</p>
<p>In this paper I introduce and partially develop a new model of technological change, viewed as the product of a class of problem-solving producers. The model is built up from the premise that all knowledge resides in the head of some individual person, so that the knowledge of its members. A main feature of the model will be the social or reciprocal character of intellectual activity: Each person gains from the knowledge of the people around him; his ideas in turn stimulate others.</p>
<p>As we will see, this idea is very flexible, but to develop it we need to have a tractable mathematical idealization of an individual’s knowledge, of the relation of this knowledge to his productivity, and of the process by which new knowledge is aquired. Everything in this paper is based on the Kortum (1997) model of the technology frontier,, a differential equation describing the evolution of the production frontier introduced in Eaton ad Kortum (1999), and an adaption of this equation due to Alvarez et al. (2007). The necessary details are provided in the next setion, in the context of a one-good economy with a labour-only production technology. In Section II, a cohort structure is introduced, so that individual careers will have a begining, middle and end, as they do in reality. Section III discusses the possibility of using cross-section evidence on individual earnings, in addition to aggregate data, to calibrate the model. Section IV considers the incorporation of schooling into the cohort model. Section V contains conclusions and further speculations.</p>
<p>Kortum (1997) and Eaton and Kortum (1999) consider models in which different agents have different knowledge and a description of the state of knowledge of an economy requires the entire distribution of knowledge over individual agents. Kortum (1997) calls this distribution the technology frontier, a usage I will follow here. In different applications, an ‘agent’ can be a firm, a plant or even an entire country. In this paper, an agent will be an individual person and the knowledge of any collection of people is just the distinct, privately held knowledge of the individuals that comprise it. I will thus interpret Eaton and Kortum’s theory in the style of Jovanovic (1979), as a stochastic process model of individual careers.</p>
<p>To begin, we consider an economy with a continuum of infinitely-lived people. Each person has one unit of labour per unit of time, and labour is the only factor of production. Everyone produces the same, single, non-storable good, which I will call simply GDP. The productivity of each person – the amount he can produce per unit of time – is a random variable, z, say. The distribution of these individual productivities at any date t is the technology frontier, represented by the cdf G(.,t) (and density g(.,t)) of z. Then GDP per person in the economy is y(t)=∫zg(z,t)dz.</p>
<p>The productivity of any individual evolves as follows. Suppose he has the productivity z at date t, viewed as a draw from the date-t technology frontier G(.,t). Over the time interval (t,t+h) he gets αh independent draws from another distribution, with cdf H. Let y denote the best of these draws. Then at t+h his productivity will be the higher of his original productivity z and the best of his new ideas y, or max(z,y). It follows that the probability that he has the same productivity z at t+h as he had at t is the probability he does not get any better ideas between t and t+h, or G(z,t+h)=G(z,t)*Pr{all αh draws&lt;=z}=G(z,t)H(z)αh.<br>Take logs, divide by h and let h→0 to get dln(G(z,t))/dt=αln(H(z,t))</p>
<p>So if we know the source distribution H(.,t) of ideas and the initial frontier distribution G(z,0), we know the complete evolution of the frontier.</p>
<p>As is clear from Eaton and Kortum’s work, this set-up can be developed in a variety of ways. For my purposes here, I want to close the system and obtain an endogenous growth theory. To do this, nothing more is involved than equating H and G, which is to say, assuming that the source of everyone’s ideas is other people in the same economy. In this case, we have the autonomous equation dln(G(z,t))/dt=αln(G(z,t)). It tells us that everyone’s productivity is always improving, unless there is a maximum productivity level (a z value that G(z,0)=1) and someone has attained it.</p>
<p>We can say that productivities have a Frechet distribution with parameters (λ,θ). Instead of tracking the entire distribution G, we can track the single parameter λ(t), the only changing feature of the distribution.</p>
<p>One way to proceed from this point would be to view this model of idea flows and individual productivity as a theory of the growth of the effective labour input, and to introduce preference, physical capital accumulation – the entire apparatus of neoclassical growth theory. The details of these extensions are familar, but I will continue – for simplicity only – to work with a labour-only technology. In any case, notice that with or without physical capital, the mystery of TFP growth has disappeared! Later on we will estimate θ from the variability of individual earnings, but the parameter α – the rate at which ideas are processed – remains free. For the USA, for example, we could simply calibrate α to the value (0.02)/θ, once we have θ, and per capita GDP growth will be ‘explained’ as much as it will ever be by a purely economic theory. Moreover, the parameterization of the model invites us to think about the sources of growth in an organized way, in terms of its three constituent parameters: each agent’s own efforts and ability to process ideas, α, the average quality of his environment, λ, and the diversity of his environment, θ.</p>
<p>Individual contributions to the growth of knowledge vary widely, depending on differences in people’s ability and in the way they allocate their time. The reason we need a theory of knowledge creation is to gain the ability to analyse the effects of such individual differences. The approach taken in the last section will be useful, then, only insofar as it can be adapted to situations in which agents differ in more fundamental respects than in their random productivity draws.</p>
<p>In the models of the last two sections two parameters, the idea-processing rate α and the Frechet variance parameter θ, combine to determine the rate of ϒ technological change. Unless we can find other sources of evidence on α and θ this hardly seems an advance over simply assuming a given ϒ value, as in the original Solow model. These models are a little too abstract to support a full discussion of this issue, but I want to explore it in a premilinary way in this section. The cohort model of Section II predict the entire age-earnings (or experience-earnings) profiles for everyone in the economy and the way these profiles evolve over time. There is a vast amount of evidence on individual earnings for the US economy. Why not use some of it to test the model and to estimate its parameters?</p>
<p>To do this, I will use earnings from the 1990 US census, viewing these data as though they were observations on a balanced growth path of the theoretical, labour-only economy. These earnings data are broken down by sex, race and schooling levels attained as well as by age, so some decisions need to be made as to how model and data are to be matched. In this section, I treat white, male heads of households who have graduated from high school and not gone on to college as constituting the entire population and use their yearly earnings as the measure of productivity. This will be adequate to illustrate the main identification and calibration issues.</p>
<p>The fact that the variance of log earnings increases with age, rather than remaining constant, does not much affect the accuracy of the calibration, but it is a symptom of a difficulty with the theory that should not be ignored. The observation itself is very solid. It shows up in the earlier censuses (see Heckman et al. 2006). It is documented by Deaton and Paxson (1994), using household survey data from the US, the UK and Taiwan. It should be clear from my mathematical development of this model, not to mention all of the applications in trade theory stemming from Eaton and Kortum (2002), that most if not all of the convenience of the model is lost if θ is not constant. On the other hand, as the cohort analysis in Section II makes clear, the theory can easily accommodate mixtures of populations with different λ or μ parameters. Perhaps the increasing trend we see in the empirical variances can be viewed as arising from mixtures, changing over time, of different populations with constant, common θ values. At present, this is obviously pure speculation.</p>
<p>The calibration strategy illustrated in this section treats stochastic productivity shocks, drawn by all workers from a common distribution, as the only sources of earnings variability. This is obviously not the case for the economy as a whole, as I have already acknowledged implicitly by treating the subset of male high school graduates as though it were the entire labour force. But even within this group, or within any group defined by observable characteristics, unobserved differences in ability will be an added source of earnings variation. Estimation of the Frechet parameter θ, interpreted as I am doing in this paper, requires taking a position on the relative importance of different sources of earnings variability, for different subsets of the workforce.</p>
<p>A theory of endogenous growth should offer more than a pretty story about parameters that, in practice, we simply treat as unalterable givens. It should help us to think operationally about the way changes in the way time and other resources are allocated can have differential effects on productivity growth. This is the virtue of Romer’s (1990) and Grossman and Helpman’s (1991) models of inventive activity in patent-protected products, set in environments of imperfect competition. But my own sense is that patents and ‘intellectual property’ more generally play a very modest role in the overall growth of production-related knowledge. I have sought a formulation that emphasizes individual contributions of large numbers of people, in which the role of market power is minimized, models that offer natural connections between theoretical variables and observables.</p>
