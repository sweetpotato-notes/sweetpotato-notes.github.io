        <p>Much of American legal activity during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries centered on the transfer of a continent of natural resources – agricultural land, water, timber, mineral deposits – from public to private control. That transfer was crucial for the development of an economic system based largely on private incentives and market transactions. Legal policy at both the state and federal level regarding natural resource ownership and use has been the focus of work by Paul W. Gates, Willard Hurst, Harry Scheiber, and others. Those studies have generally been aimed at describing the nature and impact of governmental support for private economic activities. This paper is concerned with a somewhat different question – the timing and emergence of particular legal institutions (laws and governments). The framework for the study is that offered by Lance Davis and Douglass North in Institutional Change and American Economic Growth. There they hypothesize that institutions develop in response to changing private needs or profit potentials: ‘It is the possibility of profits that cannot be captured within the existing arrangemental structure that leads to the formation of new (or the mutation of old) institutional arrangements.’ Essentially the historians, notably Lawrence Friedman and Willard Hurst. They argue that the law, and as they change, they force legal institutions to change. Friedman ties this view closely to the Davis-North model in A History of American Law, where he argues that competing interest groups are the primary determinants of the nature of the law at any one time. This view of legal institutional change is in sharp contrast to the common law tradition of legal history which sees the law as an autonomous institution passed on from generation to generation – an institution that molds the economic, political, and social inputs from society.</p>
<p>To determine the incentives mine owners would have for changing the legal rights structure, I focus on the net gains received by them from laws of varing specificity and enforcement. On the benefit side greater precision in the law increases the probability a mine owner will maintain control of his claim. That is, greater definition and enforcement of his private rights reduces ownership uncertainty. First, as individual rights and property boundaries are more clearly defined, trespass and theft can be more readily detected and proven; second, state protection of private rights can be more easily obtained as the procedure for doing so is made clear; and third, violators of private claims are more apt to be found guilty when the obligations of enforcing officials are exactly described. Increased precision in the law, however, involves private costs. Due to a lack of state or federal mining law to borrow from, there are learning costs in determining the appropriate statutory response to new conditions. In addition there are lobby expenditures for influencing legislators, judges, and other enforcing officials; and taxes from government operations. Private costs are likely to be affected by a number of factors such as the physical nature of ore deposits, existing institutional arrangements, and the number of claimants involved. With these private costs and benefits in mind, I argue that mine owners will push for greater precision in the legal rights structure as long as there are private net gains from doing so.</p>
<p>In applying this model it is not necessary to measure directly the private net gains in order to understand the incentive for legal change. Instead, one can follow economic events which would alter private costs and benefits and then determine if the predicted changes in the law occur. In particular, new ore discoveries within a mine would increase short-term nature of most mining camps, current ore production was likely the most important determinant of the expected present value of ownership. Ore strikes, however, would encourage competition for the land, leading to greater uncertainty. Accordingly, as ore strikes occur, increasing mine output, one would expect lobby activity by owners to make mineral rights law more specific and enforcement more elaborate as long as uncertainty exists. This expectation leads to two testable hypotheses. First, mineral rights law will be made more specific and enforecement more elaborate as the value of mine output increases due to ore discoveries. (The value of mine output is used as a proxy for the expected present value of mine ownership.) Second, when the legal rights structure is highly defined and enforced, further increases in the precision of the law will occur at a slower rate. As uncertainty is reduced, the private benefits from additional legal change decline.</p>
<p>The historical progression of laws and governments in Nevada seems to fit closely the pattern predicted by the model, which indicated that mine owners would lobby for changes in legal institutions as a means of reducing ownership uncertainty. The fluid nature of the mining camp, whith repeated ore strikes within mines, which increased the expected value of claim ownership, stimulated new rounds of competition and uncertainty, and forced successive revisions of mining law. This process continued until the late 1860s, by which time rights were relatively secure. Mineral rights law became highly defined through the enactment of 178 statutes and Supreme Court verdicts by 1895 – the situation stood in sharp contrast to the general, unwritten rules that had existed in 1858.</p>
