        <p>Each of these models doubtless contains elements of truth. None the less, one can ask whether they capture a sufficiently large fraction of it. One could question, for example, the implicit hypothesis underlying the views of Becker and Buchanan that all participants understand their own self-intertest. An important issue is where the role of knowledge, and of the technocrats who implement controls, enters into such an analysis.</p>
<p>Moreover, almost all the models implicitly or explicitly address controls as if they were a once-and-for-all phenomenon. In many situations, one has more the impression that politicians impose a control with a certain naivete as to its ramifications; that the market then reacts to minimize the cost of the control; that the politicians in turn find the market solution unacceptable and then alter the control, only to have the market once again react. If this view is correct, a control cannot be analysed as a static, unchanging set of regulations, and must be seen in light of the economic-political forces that it sets in motion to result in continuing evolution of the programme.</p>
<p>As will be seen, the evolution of the American sugar programme contains elements of almost all the models discussed above. Additionally, it is certainly a programme that evolved over time, where market interactions with controls affected not only outcomes, but even the position of various participants with respect to the desirability of controls. Moreover, it is also a programme whose evolution depended, in important ways, on the fact that it was highly complex; complexity in effect created a barrier to entry into the political arena, and thus facilitated the perpetuation of the programme; it also created a vested interest in the perpetuation of the programme on the part of knowledgeable parties. Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, the evolution of the sugar programme is full of ‘mistakes’, in the sense that various parties on not infrequent occasions took policy stances that turned out, at a later date, to be against their own self-interest.</p>
<p>The price of sugar has always displayed volatility on international markets. Two factors contributed to this. First, there is an 18-month lag between planting of cane and first harvesting. Thereafter, cane is usually cut two more times at approximately six-month intervals before the field is cleared and a new crop planted. Thus, when sugar prices rise, there is a longer time-lag than for annual crops (although not as long as for some tree crops) before additional production reaches the market. When the sugar price falls, it can be an even longer time before the planting response is reflected in reduced sugar output, unless of course the price falls so low that harvesting proves unprofitable. Second, and at least as important, the fact that the international market is a residual has intensified these price swings.</p>
<p>There is little reason to question Johnson’s conclusions today. Indeed, subsequent bankruptcies, the failure of the industry to expand despite greater protection and higher real producer sugar prices, all suggest that most of the cost of the sugar programme was absorbed by the excess cost of production. Indeed, even the argument first put forth in 1934 – that the United States should have some domestic production capbility in the event that foreign suppliers were disrupted – no longer seems compelling in light of the HFCS substitution possibilities.</p>
<p>The conclusion, then, is that surely in the longer run there were few domestic economic interests that gained from the sugar programme; gains were at best short-term. Even then, it must be asked why the various lobbying groups fought hard for expansion of domestic American sugar acreage: increasing the number of mills in 1962 surely did not benefit existing sugar growers Outside of Hawaii, more than half the acreage under production in 1985 was devoted to other crops as recently as 1960. It is interesting to speculate on the type of political-market model that would yield an outcome in which the chief gainers from controls had no voice in the decisions to adopt those controls.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that economic interests and lobbying go part way toward explaining the sugar programme. There are missing elements, however, to which attention now turns. First, it is apparent that institutional mechanisms were necessary in order to facilitate the continuation of the programme, and that alternative arrangements might have reduced the economic costs of the programme, even if they would not have elimited it. Second, it is clear that markets reacted to the various shifts and turns in policy in ways which neither politicians nor sugar interests anticipated. In this sense, there never was ‘the’ sugar programme; rather, policies evolved over time as politicians reacted to market responses (and exogenoug events) and markets reacted to the changes in policy. Finally, any reading of the evolution of sugar policies over time suggests that a number of key issues surrouning transparency, knowledge, and the role of technocrats must be addressed.</p>
<p>There are two interesting mental experiments that can be performed: (I) what would have happened had the Cuban Government not changed, and (II) what would have happened if there had been no sugar programme prior to 1960 when the Cuban Government changed? In answer to the first, the most reasonable conjecture would appear to be that the US Sugar Program would have continued, mush as before, and that there never would have been the expansion of beet acreage and high-cost (and possibly even ill-advised on the part of those who undertook them) expansions of beet-refining capacity that characterized the 1960s. It is hard to imagine the impetus that would have been necessary to increase substantially American acreage at the expense of imports.</p>
<p>With regard to the second question, had there been no sugar programme in 1960 the most likely outcome is that the United States would have continued buying sugar on world markets. It is difficult to imagine a sequence of events under which a changed Cuban Government could have been seized upon as a rationale for the inauguration of a Sugar Program.</p>
<p>In so far as these conjectures are plausible, they strongly suggest that it is much easier to adapt, or seize, an already-existing instrument, than it is to have a new one created. For that reason alone, an existing instrument is very likely to become used for objectives and by groups that may not have been the intended beneficiaries at all when the instrument was first formed.</p>
<p>No case study can provide the generalizations desirable to form a basis for a theory of political-economic interactinos. The US Sugar Program is, none the less, interesting in that it raises some questions that are not readily handled with the use of traditional models. Its evolution demonstrates that a static analysis of the costs and benefits of the programme at a point in time would significantly misstate the programme’s impact: clearly account must be taken of the ways in which economic and political responses will alter the programme over time. It is to be hoped that future reaserch will enable the transformation of some of the questions raised here into testable hypotheses.</p>
<p>At this stage, the conclusions that emerge arise primarily with regard to the sugar programme itself. First, when it was originally formulated in 1934, and then when it was reinstated in 1948, the intentions of its advocates bore little resemblance to the purposes to which it was put some 20 or 30 years later. Second, it seems highly unlikely that the electorate would support a programme that provides payments of over $136,000 per farm were that figure highly publicized. Third, at least some of the supporters of the sugar programme over the years – the importers and refiners of raw suger and the beet-mill owners who went bankrupt at the very least – would not have been so enthusiastic had they known the outcome.</p>
