        <p>An economic problem exists whenever scarce means are used to satisfy alternative ends.<br>If the means are not scarce, there is no problem at all; there is Nirvana. If the means are scarce but there is only a single end, the problem of how to use the means is a technological problem. No value judgements enter into its solution; only knowledge of physical and technical relationships.</p>
<p>Knight points out in his Economic Organization, the economic problem may be subdivided into five interrelated problems:<br>1) fixing standards<br>2) organizing production<br>3) distributing the product<br>4) providing for economic maintenance and progress<br>5) adjusting consumption to production over short periods</p>
<p>In a free-enterprise exchange economy this task is accomplished essentially through voting, voting in the market place with dollars.</p>
<p>Prices of products in relation to the costs of producing them determine the distribution of resources among industries; the relative prices of factors, in turn, determine the coordination of factors within industries.</p>
<p>Prices thus serve as guideposts to where resources are wanted most, and, in addition, prices provide the incentive for people to follow these guideposts.</p>
<p>Prices, therefore, do three kinds of things in solving the above firve problems.<br>They transmit information effectively and efficiently;<br>they provide an incentive to users of resources to be guided by this information;<br>and they provide in incentive to owners of resources to follow this information.</p>
<p>There is the problem of over-simplification and the problem that description always sounds like justification.<br>The problem solved by a price system is an extremely complicated one, involving the coordination of the activities of tens and hundreds of millions of people all over the globe and their prompt adjustement to ever-changing conditions.  The price system is an extremely subtle and complex device for solving this problem.<br>Casual observation of the world leads to an underestimation of the complexity of both the problem and the device used to solve it, because insofar as the price system works we are hardly conscious of its workings. The conplexities are brought to our attention only when something goes wrong.<br>Similarly, a summary description necssarily involves over-simplification, emphasis on the highlights and neglect of not unimportant details. </p>
<p>In any normative judgement of the price system on the basis of the preceding description, several things must be kept in mind.<br>First, this description implicitly supposes the existence of effective competition in translating consumer wishes into productive activity. It is assumed that people can affect their incomes only through use of their resources and not through interference with the price system. There is freedom to compete but not freedom to combine.<br>Second, the controlling force is pecuniary demand; voting is in proportion to the number of dollars a person had. This is not obviously ‘just’. The basic inequality, it should be noted, is an inequality in the ownership of resources. What the market does is primarily to determine the return per unit of resource, and there is no reason to believe that the market aggravates the inequality in the ownership of resources.<br>Moreover, any given degree of inequality is a much more serious one in an economy which is governed largely by status or tradition than in a market economy where there is much chance for shifts in the ownership of resources. Historically, the fundamental inequality of economic status has been and is almost certainly greater in economies that do not rely on the free market than in those that do.</p>
<p>The economist has little to say about the formation of wants; this is the province of the psychologist. The econmist’s task is to trace the consequences of any given set of wants.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the word ‘demand’ will be used only when reference is being made to the demand schedule; and the words ‘quantity demanded’ will be used when reference is being make to a particular quantity.</p>
<p>At point A (equalibrium point) the underlying forces of demand and supply, not demand and supply themselves, have established a price which equates the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded.</p>
<p>The more inelastic the demand curve the greater will be the fluctuation in price due to a given change in quantity supplied.</p>
<p>In the shortest of all runs, where conditions are allowed to vary very little, one would expect the demand curve to have the least elasticity. As the range of conditions which are allowed to vary is widened, one would expect the elasticity of the demand curve to increase.</p>
<p>The theoretical explanation offered for the backward bending segment of the supply curve is that a rise in the real wage rate arising from an increased demand for labor has two effects: (1) It makes leisure more expensive, since the cost of an hour of leisure is the wage that could be earned in that hour. This is the substitution effect, and by itself would tend to raise the number of hours worked. (2) If the individual were to work the same number of hours, the rise in the real wage rate increases his real income, which would lead him to want to purchase more of various kinds of goods, including leisure. This is the income effect, and by itself would tend to reduce the number of hours worked unless leisure is an inferior good.</p>
<p>It therefore follows that on the margin everything is equally necessary or equally unnecessary.</p>
<p>The elasticity of demand will depend primarily on the availability of substitutes. Consequently, the more narrowly defined is the comodity in question, the more substitutes will be available and the greater the elasticity of demand for the commodity. Thus the elasticity of demand for white bread is greater than the elasticity of demand for bread.</p>
<p>Consider the following, each of which is sometimes included in ceteris paribus:<br>1) Prices of all other products<br>2) Quantities of all other products<br>3) Money income or money expenditures of consumers</p>
<p>It (‘Walrasian’ function) is an extremely useful abstract conception to bring out the logic of the interrelation of the price system; it cannot be used to analyze a concrete problem.</p>
<p>Diminishing marginal utility will provide a negative slope for the demand curve, but the fact that the demand curve has a negative slope does not require diminishing marginal utility.</p>
<p>The slope of the indifference curve is the rate of substitution in consumption.<br>The slope of the budget line represents the rate of substitution in purchase.<br>This budget line does not necessarily have to be a straight line.</p>
<p>A good is said to be a superior good if the quantity consumed increases as income increases and an inferior good if the quantity consumed decreases as income increases.</p>
<p>Income elasticity is frequently used to define the terms ‘necessities’ and ‘luxuries’. A good is termed a ‘necessity’ if its income elasticity is less than unity, a ‘luxury’ if its income elasticity is greater than unity.</p>
