        <p>In the closing decades of the twentieth century, China defied the best predictions of development economists and Sinologists alike in compiling a stunning record of economic growth. This was accomplished in the face of formidable obstacles including inefficient state enterprises, ambiguous property rights, irrational prices, primitive transportation, and outmoded banking and securities facilities. </p>
<p>In sum, reforms generated both from above and from below have brought far-reaching, even cataclysmic, changes to the economy, society, politics and culture, changes that touch every citizen and extend to every corner of the land and beyond to redefine China’s place in the world.</p>
<p>It is commonly asserted that, despite far-reaching economic and social reform, China’s political system remains frozen.</p>
<p>Despite significant changes, an apparent disjuncture remains between the free-wheeling economic expansion, on the one hand, and the still highly circumscribed political climate, on the other.</p>
<p>The upsurge in such activities is attributable to several factors attendant upon the reforms: increased population mobility, high levels of surplus labour and unemploymen, growing income disparities, access to previously unavailable economic resources, and declining civic values.</p>
<p>The problem with the diverse theories sketched briefly above is that, while suggestive for analysing the psychological and material roots of protests, resistance, rebellion and revolution, none specifies the threshold point at which popular aspirations and grievances gain sufficient momentum to become politically threatening. Thus, however useful the theories may be in offering explanations for what occurred after the fact, and in drawing attention to areas of conflict and potential resistance, they offer little predictive value.</p>
<p>China’s extensive and deepening integration into the international system in general, and its various commitments to international laws and institutions in particular, have placed leaders under new constraints and provided dissidents with new sources of moral support.</p>
<p>Both liberty and equality are among the primary goals pursued by human beings throughout many centuries; but total liberty for wolves is death to the lambs, total liberty of the powerful, the gifted, is not compatible with the rights to a decent existence of the weak and the less gifted… Equality may demand the restraint of the liberty of those who wish to dominate; liberty - without some modicum of which there is not choice and therefore no possibility of remaining human as we understand the word - may have to be curtailed in order to make room for social welfare, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, to leave room for the liberty of others, to allow justice or fairness to be exercised.</p>
<p>Neo-liberal economists cautioned that an economy based on state ownership of the means of production could not sustain long-term, stable growth. In their view, privatization is a conditio sine qua non for the market economy This premise, enshrined in the ‘Washington Consensus’ became the guiding principle for many of the social engineering programmes of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the former Soviet Union and the East-bloc countries.</p>
<p>Women’s employment must be linked with women’s liberation. Economics is the foundation. Without participation in social production, women would have no economic status. This would in turn undermine the equality between men and women in politics, society and family.</p>
