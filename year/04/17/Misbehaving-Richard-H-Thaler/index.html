        <p>The foundation of political economy and, in general, of every social science, is evidently psychology. A day may come when we shall be able to deduce the laws of social science from the principles of psychology. – Vilfredo Pareto, 1906</p>
<p>The core premise of economic theory is that people choose by optimizing.</p>
<p>This premise of constrained optimization, that is, choosing the best from a limited budget, is combined with the other major workhorse of economic theory, that of equilibrium. In competitive markets where prices are free to move up and down, those prices fluctuate in such a way that supply equals demand.</p>
<p>To simplify somewhat, we can say that<br>Optimization + Equilibrium = Economics<br>This is a powerful combination, nothing that other social sciences can match. </p>
<p>There is, however, a problem: the premises on which economic theory rests are flawed.<br>First, the optimization problems that ordinary people confront are often too hard for them to solve, or even come close to solving.<br>Second, the beliefs upon which people make their choices are not unbiased. Overconfidence may not be in the economists’ dictionary, but it is a well-established feature of human nature, and there are countless other biases that have been documented by psychologists.<br>Third, there are many factors that the optimization model leaves out, as my story about the 137-point exam illustrates. In a world of Econs, there is a long list of things that are supposedly irrelevant. </p>
<p>The good news is that we do not need to throw away everything we know about how economies and markets work. Theories based on the assumption that everyone is an Econ should not be discarded. They remain useful as starting points for more realistic models. And in some special circumstances, such as when the problems people have to solve are easy or when the actors in the economy have the relevant highly specialized skills, then models of Econs may provide a good approximation of what happens in the real world. But as we will see, those situations are the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Moreover, much of what economists do is to collect and analyze data about how markets work, work that is largely done with great care and statistical expertise, and importantly, most of this research does not depend on the assumption that people optimize.</p>
<p>Two research tools that have emerged over the past twenty-five years have greatly expanded economists’ repertorie for learning about the world.<br>The first is the use of randomized control trial experiments, long used in other scientific fields such as medicine. The typical study investigates what happens when some people receive some ‘treatment’ of interest.<br>The second approach is to use either naturally ocurring experiments (such as when some people are enrolled in a program and others are not) or clever econometrics techniques that manage to detect the impact of treatments even though no one deliberately designed the situation for that purpose.</p>
<p>These studies show that one can learn a lot about the world without imposing optimizing models, and in some cases provide credible evidence against which to test such models and see if they match actual human responses.</p>
<p>We don’t have to stop inventing abstract models that describe the behavior of imaginary Econs. We do, however, have to stop assuming that those models are accurate descriptions of behavior, and stop basing policy decisions on such flawed analyses. And we have to start paying attention to those supposedly irrelevant factors, what I will call SIFs for short.</p>
<p>The field has become known as ‘behavioral economics’. It is not a different discipline: it is still economics, but it is economics done with strong injections of good psychology and other social sciences.</p>
<p>The primary reason for adding Humans to economic theories is to improve the accuracy of the predictions made with those theories.</p>
<p>The opportunity cost of some some activity is what you give up by doing it.<br>Giving up the opportunity to sell something does not hurt as much as taking the money out of your wallet to pay for it. Opportunity costs are vague and abstract when compared to handing over actual cash. Paying a surcharge is out of pocket, whereas not receiving a discount is a “mere” opportunity cost.<br>I called this phenomenon the ‘endowment effect’ because, in economists’ lingo, the stuff you own is part of your endowment, and I had stumbled upon a finding that suggested people valued things that were already part of their endowment more highly than things that could be part of their endowment, that were available but not yet owned.</p>
<p>‘Hindsight bias’: the finding is that, after the fact, we think that we always knew the outcome was likely, if not a foregone conclusion.<br>What makes the bias particularly pernicious is that we all recognize this bias in others but not in ourselves.</p>
<p>Judegement under uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.<br>The thesis of the paper was simple and elegant. Humans have limited time and brainpower. As a result, they use simple rules of thumb-heuristics-to help them make judgments.<br>Using these heuristics causes people to make predictable errors. </p>
<p>A forerunner of Kahneman and Tversky was Herbert Simon, a polymath academic who spent most of his career at Carnegie Mellon University. Simon was well known in nearly every field of social science, including economics, political science, artificial intelligence, and organizational theory, but most germane to this book, he wrote about what he called ‘bounded rationality’ well before Kahneman and Tversky came along.<br>In saying that people have bounded rationality, Simon meant that they lack the cognitive ability to solve complex problems, which is obviously true.</p>
<p>In every case, economic theory had a highly specific prediction about some key factor – such as the presence of the cashews or the amount paid for the basketball game tickets – that the theory said should not influence decisions. They were all supposedly irrelevant factors, or SIFs. Much subsequent work in behavioral economics has been to show which SIFs are in fact highly relevant in predicting behavior, often by taking advantages of the systematic biases suggested in Tversky and Kahneman’s 1974 paper.</p>
<p>The fact that we experience diminishing sensitivity to changes away from the status quo captures another basic human trait – one of the earliest findings in psychology – known as the Weber-Fechner Law. The Weber-Fechner Law holds that the just-noticeable difference (JND) in any variable is proportional to the magnitude of that variable.</p>
<p>The reason why people are risk-seeking for losses is the same logic that applies to why they are risk averse for gains.<br>So, we experience life in terms of changes, we feel diminishing sensitivity to both gains and losses, and losses sting more than equivalently sized gains feel good.</p>
<p>The two central concepts of economics remained the same – namely, that agents optimize and markets reach a stable equilibrium – but economists became more sophisticated in their ability to characterize the optimal solutions to problems as well as to determine the conditions under which a market will reach an equilibrium.</p>
<p>Because learning takes practice, we are more likely to get things right at small stakes than at large stakes. This means critics have to decide which argument they want to apply. If learning is crucial, then as the stakes go up, decision-making quality is likely to go down.</p>
<p>I am ususally pretty good about ignoring sunk costs, especailly if the sunk costs are purely monetary in nature. But like most people, if I have put a lot of work into some project I can find it difficult to give it up, even if it is clearly the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Like most aspects of mental accounting, setting up non-fungible budgets is not entirely silly. Be it with mason jars, envelops, or sophisticated financial apps, a household that makes a serious efforts to create a financial plan will have an easier time living within its means.</p>
<p>A good rule to remember is that people who are threatened with big losses and have a chance to break even will be unusually willing to take risks, even if they are normally quite risk averse. Watch out!</p>
<p>To understand the consumption behavior of households, we clearly need to get back to studying Humans rather than Econs. Humans do not have the brains of Einstern (or Barro), nor do they have the self-control of an ascetic Buddhist monk. Rather, they have passions, faulty telescopes, treat various pots of wealth quite diferently, and can be influenced by short-run returns in the stock market. We need a model of these kinds of Humans.</p>
<p>As usual in these cases when demand has suddenl risen, a seller has to trade off short-term gain against possible long-term loss of good will, which can be hard to measure.</p>
<p>But any large first mover who takes ac action that violates the norms of fairness runs considerable risks if competitors do not follow suit.</p>
<p>‘If you gouge them at Christmas they won’t come back in March.’ That remains good advice for any business that is interested in building a loyal clientele.</p>
<p>‘It is incredibly important for any business, no matter how great the demand, not to charge a customer more than the good or service is worth – even if the customer is willing to pay more.’</p>
<p>A large proportion of people can be categorized as conditional cooperators, meaning that they are willing to give their fellow players the benefit of the doubt, but if coopration rates are low, these conditional cooperation cooperators turn into free riders.</p>
<p>Losses are roughly twice as painful as gains are pleasurable, a finding that has been replicated numerous times over the years.</p>
<p>The endowment effect experiments show that people have a tendency to stick with what they have, at least in part because of loss aversion.</p>
<p>Loss aversion and status quo bias will often work together as forces that inhibit change.</p>
<p>It is much easier to detect that we may be in a bubble than it is to say when it will pop, and investors who attempt to make money by timing market turns are rarely successful.</p>
<p>Without the rational framework, there are no anomalies from which we can detect misbehavior. Furthermore, there is not as yet a benchmark behavioral theory of asset prices that could be used as a theoretical underpinning of empirical research. We need some starting point to organize our thoughts on any topic, and the EMH remains the best one we have.</p>
<p>There are definitely anomalies: sometimes the market overreacts, and sometimes it underreacts. But it remains the case that most active money managers fail to beat the market. And as the story about Royal Dutch Shell and LTCM shows, even when investors can know for sure that prices are wrong, these prices can still stay wrong, or even get more wrong. This should rightly scare investors who think they are smart and want to exploit apparent mispricing. It is possible to make money, but it is not easy. Certainly, investors who accept the EMH gospel and invest in low-cost index funds cannot be faulted for that choice.</p>
<p>Instead of expecting mean reversion, people were acting as if what goes up must go up even more.</p>
<p>Five findings from the psychology of decision-making supported our hypothesis that early picks will be too expensive:</p>
<ol>
<li>People are overconfident</li>
<li>People make forecasts that are too extreme</li>
<li>The winner’s curse</li>
<li>The false consensus effect</li>
<li>Present bias</li>
</ol>
<p>A nudge is some smal feature in the environment that attracts out attention and influences behavior.’</p>
<p>If you want people to comply with some norm or rule, it is a good strategy to inform them (if true) that most other people comply.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to encourage someone to do something, make it easy.</li>
<li>We can’t do evidence-based policy without evidence.<br>分享： </li>
