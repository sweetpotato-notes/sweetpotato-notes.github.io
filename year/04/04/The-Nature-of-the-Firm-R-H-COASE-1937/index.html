        <p>Mrs. Robinson has said that ‘the two questions to be asked of a set of assumptions in economics are: Are they tractable? and: Do they correspond with the real world?’ Though, as Mrs. Robinson points out, ‘More often one set will be manageable and the other realistic,’ yet there may well be branches of theory where assumptions may be both manageable and realistic.</p>
<p>It is hoped to show in the following paper that a definition of a firm may be obtained which is not only realistic in that it corresponds to what is meant by a firm in the real world, but is tractable by two of the most powerful instruments of economic analysis developed by Marshall, the idea of the margin and that of substitution, together giving the idea of substitution at the margin. Our definition must, of course, ‘relate to formal relations which are capable of being conceived exactly’.</p>
<p>At the margin, the costs of organizing within the firm will be equal either to the costs of organizing in another firm or to the costs involved in leaving the transaction to be ‘organized’ by the price mechanism. Business men will be constantly experimenting, controlling more or less, and in this way, equilibrium will be maintained.</p>
<p>The main points appear in ‘The nature of the firm’: the choice of the transaction as the unit of analysis, the concept of transaction costs, the distinction between the allocation of resources within the firm and through the market, the comparison of the costs of organizing a transaction within the firm and by means of a market transaction, and so on.</p>
<p>Transactions costs and internal labor markets – by Sherwin Rosen</p>
<p>Coase argues that firms exist because some transactions internal to firms are less costly than similar transactions carried out in markets. The limits of the firm depend on cost comparisons at these margins.</p>
<p>If the number of prices necssary to decentralize a complex interactive organization increases multiplicatively with size, then the amount and cost of monitoring required to achieve efficiency also must grow with size. Information becomes garbled as it passes through longer chains, and information channels become congested as chain-of command lengthen (Williamson, 1967). It is the balancing of joint-production and scale economies against increasing costs of control associated with nonmarket transactions costs that determines organization size in traditional theory.</p>
<p>The avoidance of monitoring cost preoccupies the modern literature on agency theory. The main question posed is: Can penalty and reward systems be found  that result in self-enforcing contracts? If so, then internal decentralization may be efficient and the size of firms could be very large indeed. A fundamental result proves that multipart pricing is necessary to induce an agent to behave in the interests of the principal.</p>
<p>Another approach to the principal-agent problem generalizes decentralized output-reward systems to include considerations of risk sharing (Holmstrom, 1979). The problem is set up to investigate the consequences of hidden actions of the agent. The principal cannot observe the agent’s action but can observe the output that is the result of these actions. There cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between output and action or else the principal could infer actions perfectly and the problem is trival. So output is a mixture of random effects and unobserved actions. If output is large, the principal cannot tell if the agent worked very hard or was very lucky. Similarly, a small output could have been due to bad luck rather than shirking.</p>
<p>The interactions of personnel within organizations are too complicated to be completely decentralized through a price mechanism.</p>
<p>The firm’s observed production and cost functions are the outcomes of the interaction between production technology, personnel policy, management, and institutional rules and design.</p>
<p>The flow and direction of personnel through positions in the firm can be thought of as an ‘internal labor market.’ </p>
<p>In large organizations, it is especially important to assign the most capable and energetic people to top-level positions because top-level decisions percolate through the organiztion and have much larger effects on organizational productivity than lower-level decisions do.</p>
<p>The interaction of talent and scale can support extremely large salaries for top-level managers of large firms on marginal productivity grounds alone (Rosen, 1982), consistent with empirical findings that top executive compensation is systematically increasing with firm size (Murphy: Kostiuk) as well as with profitability.</p>
<p>Increasing the difference in wages among the topmost ranking positions maintains incentives by substituting for the option value that propelled performance incentives at lower ranks. In this sense wage structures among top executive positions reflect both the productivity of top-level managers and the productivity induced by the attempts of lower-ranking employees to climb higher.</p>
<p>These bureaucratic costs are properly considered as transactions costs of nonmarket allocations within firms and may ultimately help define the limits of the firm.</p>
<p>The logic of economic organization</p>
<p>Herbert Simon’s contrast between the physical sciences and economics in microanalytic respects is instructive. As he observes (1984:40):<br>In the physical sciences, when errors of measurement and other noise are found to be of the same order of magnitude as the phenomena undre study, the response is not to try to squeeze more information out of the data by statistical means; it is instead to find techniques for observing the phenomena at a higher level of resolution. The corresponding strategy for economics is obvious: to secure new kinds of data at the micro level.</p>
<p>Thansaction cost economics maintains that the microanalytics matter in three basic respects: (1) behavioral assumptions, (2) dimensinoalizing transactions, and (3) process features. </p>
<p>The main case to which transaction cost economics subscries has been stated by Frank Knight as follows:<br>Men in general, and within limits, wish to behave economically, to make their activities and their organization ‘efficient’ rather than wasteful. This fact does deserve the utmost emphasis; and an adequate definition of the science of economics… might well make it explicit that the main relevance of the discussion is found in its relation to social policy, assumed to be directed toward the end indicated, of increasing economic efficiency, of reducing waste.</p>
<p>Alfred Chandler’s summary of the defects of the large unitary form (U-form) enterprise, to which the multidivisional (M-form) enterprise was a response, is pertinent (1962):<br>The inherent weakness in the centralized, functionally departmentalized operating company… became critical only when the administrative load on the senior executives increased to such an extent that they were unable to handle their entrepreneurial responsibilities efficiently. This situation arose when the operations of the enterprise became too complex and the problems of coordination, appraisal, and policy formulation too intricate for a small number of top officers to handle both long-run, entrepreneurial, and short-run operational administrative activities.</p>
<p>Transaction cost economics insists that the process features of organization be examined in the context of specific contractual relationships. Greater knowledge of and attention to microanalytic detail is thus required.</p>
