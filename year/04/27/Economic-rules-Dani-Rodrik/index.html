        <p>Delegates from forty-four nations met in the New Hampshire resort of Bretton Woods in July 1944 to construct the postwar international economic order.<br>Their objective was to avoid the upheavals of the last years of the Gold Standard and of the Great Depression.<br>They agreed that achieving this goal required:<br>1) fixed, but occasionally adjustable, exchange rates;<br>2) liberalization of international trade but not capital flows;<br>3) enlarged scope for national monetary and fiscal policies;<br>4) and enhanced cooperation through two new international agencies, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (which came to be known as the World Bank).</p>
<p>A central tenet of economics holds that when it comes to the welfare of the poor, direct cash grants are more effective than subsidies on specific consumer goods.</p>
<p>Models are both economics’ strength and its Achilles’ heel; they are also what make economics a science—not a science like quantum physics or molecular biology, but a science nonetheless.</p>
<p>The diversity of models in economics is the necessary counterpart to the flexibility of the social world. Different social settings require different models. Economists are unlikely ever to uncover universal, general-purpose models.</p>
<p>They have to select their models carefully as circumstances change, or as they turn their gaze from one setting to another. They need to learn how to shift among different models more fluidly.</p>
<p>Each of these criticisms derives in large part from a failure to recognize that economics is, in fact, a collection of diverse models that do not have a particular ideological bent or lead to a unique conclusion.</p>
<p>The term “economics” has come to be used in two different ways.<br>One definition focuses on the substantive domain of study; in this interpretation, economics is a social science devoted to understanding how the economy works.<br>The second definition focuses on methods: economics is a way of doing social science, using particular tools. In this interpretation the discipline is associated with an apparatus of formal modeling and statistical analysis rather than particular hypotheses or theories about the economy.</p>
<p>The possibilities of social life are too diverse to be squeezed into unique frameworks. But each economic model is like a partial map that illuminates a fragment of the terrain. Taken together, economists’ models are our best cognitive guide to the endless hills and valleys that constitute social experience.</p>
<p>Training in economics consists essentially of learning a sequence of models. Perhaps the most important determinant of the pecking order in the profession is the ability to develop new models, or use existing models in conjunction with new evidence, to shed light on some aspect of social reality.</p>
<p>For critics, economists’ reliance on models captures almost everything that is wrong with the profession: the reduction of the complexities of social life to a few simplistic relationships, the willingness to make patently untrue assumptions, the obsession with mathematical rigor over realism, the frequent jump from stylized abstraction to policy conclusions.</p>
<p>The Cambridge University economist Ha-Joon Chang says, “95 percent of economics is common sense—made to look difficult, with the use of jargons and mathematics.”</p>
<p>In truth, simple models of the type that economists construct are absolutely essential to understanding the workings of society. Their simplicity, formalism, and neglect of many facets of the real world are precisely what make them valuable. These are a feature, not a bug.<br>What makes a model useful is that it captures an aspect of reality. What makes it indispensable, when used well, is that it captures the most relevant aspect of reality in a given context.</p>
<p>When models are selected judiciously, they are a source of illumination. When used dogmatically, they lead to hubris and errors in policy.</p>
<p>A model focuses on particular causes and seeks to show how they work their effects through the system. A modeler builds an artificial world that reveals certain types of connections among the parts of the whole—connections that might be hard to discern if you were looking at the real world in its welter of complexity.</p>
<p>Models do more than warn us that results could go either way. They are useful because they tell us precisely what the likely outcomes depend on.</p>
<p>This is the distinction that philosophers of science refer to as internal versus external validity.<br>A well-designed experiment that successfully traces out cause and effect in a specific setting is said to have a high degree of “internal validity.” But its “external validity” depends on whether its conclusion can travel successfully outside the experimental context to other settings.</p>
<p> Sound extrapolation in turn requires a combination of good judgment, evidence from other sources, and structured reasoning. The power of all these types of experiments is that they teach us something about the world outside the context in which they’re carried out, on account of our ability to discern similarity and draw parallels across diverse settings.</p>
<p>Simplification and abstraction necessarily require that many elements remain counterfactual in the sense that they violate reality. What is the best way to think about this lack of realism?</p>
<p>Economic models consist of clearly stated assumptions and behavioral mechanisms. As such, they lend themselves to the language of mathematics.</p>
<p>Math essentially plays two roles in economics, neither of which is cause for glory: clarity and consistency.<br>First, math ensures that the elements of a model—the assumptions, behavioral mechanisms, and main results—are stated clearly and are transparent. Once a model is stated in mathematical form, what it says or does is obvious to all who can read it.<br>The second virtue of mathematics is that it ensures the internal consistency of a model—simply put, that the conclusions follow from the assumptions. This is a mundane but indispensable contribution.</p>
<p>Verbal arguments that seem intuitive often collapse, or are revealed to be incomplete, under closer mathematical scrutiny. The reason is that “verbal models” can ignore nonobvious but potentially significant interactions.</p>
<p>Some branches of economics, such as mathematical economics, have come to look more like applied mathematics than like any kind of social science. Their reference point has become other mathematical models instead of the real world.</p>
<p>The good news is that, contrary to common perception, math for its own sake does not get you far in the economics profession. What’s valued is “smarts”: the ability to shed new light on an old topic, make an intractable problem soluble, or devise an ingenious new empirical approach to a substantive question. In fact, the emphasis on mathematical methods in economics is long past its peak.<br>Today, models that are empirically oriented or policy relevant are greatly preferred in top journals over purely theoretical, mathematical exercises. The profession’s stars and most heavily cited economists are those who have shed light on important public problems, such as poverty, public finance, economic growth, and financial crises—not its mathematical wizards</p>
<p>Despite the math, economic models tend to be simple. For the most part, they can be solved using pen and paper.</p>
<p>“Big data gives us a chance to view society in all its complexity,” writes one of the leading proponents of this view. This would send our traditional economic models the way of the horse and buggy.</p>
<p>As Watts notes, disturbances in one part of the economy—say, in mortgage finance —can be amplified and produce major shocks for the entire economy, as in the “butterfly effect” from chaos theory.</p>
<p>In some settings, a simple model can be, well, too simple. We may need more detail. The trick is to isolate just the interactions that are hypothesized to matter, but no more.</p>
<p>Economic models are relevant and teach us about the world because they are simple. Relevance does not require complexity, and complexity may impede relevance. Simple models —in the plural—are indispensable. Models are never true; but there is truth in models. We can understand the world only by simplifying it.</p>
