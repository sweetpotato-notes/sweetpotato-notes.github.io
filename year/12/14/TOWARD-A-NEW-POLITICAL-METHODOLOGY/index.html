        <p>Even at the most quantitative end of the profession, much contemporary empirical work has little long-term scientific value. “Theoretical models” are too often long lists of independent variables from social psychology, sociology, or just casual empiricism, tossed helter-skelter into canned linear regression packages. Among better empiricists, these “garbage-can regressions” have become a little less common, but they have too frequently been replaced by garbage-can maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs). Beginning graduate students sometimes say, “Well, I don’t really understand how these variables relate to each other and the data are bad, but I did use the newest estimator, downloaded from the Internet, and I do report heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors.”</p>
<p>Nagler (1994) applies probit, logit, and scobit to U.S. voter turnout data from the 1984 Current Population Survey from the Census Bureau, showing that scobit gives a slightly better statistical fit. He also finds that α ≈ 0.4, implying, that voters with turnout probabilities of approximately 40% are most affected by the explanatory variables. Of course, probit and logit would have imposed a value of 50% as the point of maximum impact. Thus scobit yields a genuinely different substantive interpretation.</p>
<p>We have now come to the central issue facing contemporary political methodology. Dozens of estimators might be used in any of our empirical applications. Too often, applied researchers choose the standard ones because they believe methodologists approve of them, whereas methodologists prefer some new, complicated, untested alternative because they know that the standard estimators are often ungrounded in substantive theory, and they hope that the new one might stumble onto something better. Few researchers in either group make a convincing case that their estimator is humming rather than clanking on their dataset. Even the creators of estimators usually do not prove that the supporting assumptions would make rational sense or common sense for the political actors being studied. Nor do they carry out the patient data analysis required to show that their estimator, an arbitrary selection from among dozens that might have been proposed, is more than just computable and plausible, but that its assumptions really match up in detail to the data for which it is intended. If the thing might work on some planet, we think our job is done.</p>
<p>Too many of the new estimators in political methodology are justified solely because they are one conceivable way to take account of some special feature of the data. Perhaps the dependent variable is discrete, or a duration, or a count, or an ecological average, or perhaps partially missing data. Then under some all-too-convenient assumptions, we show that the implied estimates are MLE or Bayes, and we demonstrate that our computers can solve for the parameters. Applied researchers are grateful: “An estimator that takes account of the special features of my data in a way that ordinary regression never did—hooray!” Too often, they rush out to adopt it, not noticing that it may give bizarre answers that standard, simpler, better-tested estimators, perhaps unfamiliar to them, would have avoided.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, our tools were very limited, and econometrics texts taught us, “Decide what sort of data you have, and look up the corresponding estimator.” Few questioned the assumptions closely; there were no real alternatives. But those days are long gone. No researcher should suppose now that there is just one statistically reliable technique for a given class of data. There are many, and dozens more are easily created. No one should imagine that some particular newly invented estimator emerging in a prominent political science journal is the only or best way to analyze a dataset. Applied political researchers need to wise up, and political methodologists need to stop ill-using them by promoting particular estimators on abstract grounds of greater generality. The truth is that, for virtually any political dataset in common use, dozens of statistical estimators might be tried, and we simply have not done the work needed to recommend any one of them with scientific honesty.</p>
<p>Thus, substantive formal models of a certain kind would give microfoundations to scobit and power logit. They would tell researchers that employing these special estimators is indicated, or even required. As with other estimators, arguing for the use of obscure distributions purely on grounds of computational convenience or aesthetic attractiveness should be avoided. The Burr II and exponential-Burr distributions would be derived from a clean foundational model with routine, conventional logistic errors that required no special pleading for credibility.</p>
<p>Thus, occasionally, models such as scobit, power logit, and other MLEs will be implied by a theoretical model. When they are, they have microfoundations and should be the estimator of choice. More often, though, their usefulness will be found in checking for specification errors. Like many other specification checks and tests, they can help us find model errors. When logit follows from a formal model and power logit does not, but power logit fits better, then we know something is wrong in the formal theory supporting logit or in the implementation of the logit specification. For finding our mistakes, scobit, power logit, and their estimator cousins in other applications are most helpful.</p>
<p>Nagler’s (1994) study, for example, shows that our standard specifications for voter turnout are not working in logit and probit. That is an enormously valuable contribution. But in the modern view, the implication is not necessarily that we should abandon logit and switch to one of its generalizations. It is rather that we need to think hard both about the formal theory of turnout and about the specifications we use in logit and probit to study it. (An important step toward a theoretically grounded empirical study of turnout is Sanders 2001.) If we cannot think of any reason why scobit has formal-theory support, however, then jumping to it bears a heavy burden of proof and should be considered with skepticism. Instead, the theoretically defensible goal is either to re-do the theory or, perhaps more commonly, to find and fix the specification errors in the link function. When that has been done in a context where logit has a strong, persuasive formal-theoretic justification, we expect that in the end, logit will usually turn out to have the best fit. Good theory will then be vindicated, and scobit will have played a key auxiliary role in that outcome.</p>
<p>We methodologists often find ourselves in Hempel’s “context of discovery,” with no theories, formal or otherwise, to guide us—a little social psychology, perhaps, but nothing up to the task of making our inferences reliable. Microfoundations remain the gold standard, but often we have to begin with less and search for the empirical regularities that might lead to theory. In that context of high-dimensional problems with too little theoretical structure, how can careless curve-fitting and unreliable findings be avoided?</p>
<p>The usual answer is that, in research problems without microfoundations, we need hard work, insight, and art to see patterns and establish credible empirical regularities. We think of ourselves as following that advice. But our conventional procedures have let us down, and we have had little success. None of the important empirical generalizations in the discipline has emerged from high-powered methodological research. Instead, almost without exception, they were found with graphs and cross-tabulations. Methodological advances, from multiple regression onward, have largely been irrelevant.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the variance part of the model is tricky, however. Anything that generates higher variance will improve the fit. With opinion data, ambivalence is one possibility, if it causes large error variance in responses. Alvarez &amp; Brehm stress this source of higher variance. However, extreme but opposed opinions among respondents, with no ambivalence at all, are another possible source. Careful investigation will be needed to distinguish between these alternatives.</p>
<p>Making a serious case that an estimator is working well is like validating an empirical generalization—very hard work. Traditionally, we have tried to do both with informal assumptions about the right list of control variables, linearity assumptions, distributional assumptions, and a host of other assumptions, followed by a significance test on a coefficient. But since all the assumptions are somewhat doubtful and largely untested, so are the estimators and the conclusions. The depressing consequence is that at present we have very little useful empirical work with which to guide formal theory. Behavioral work too often ignores formal theory. That might not be so bad if it did its own job well. But it produces few reliable empirical generalizations because its tests are rarely sharp or persuasive. Thus, empirical findings accumulate but do not cumulate.</p>
<p>A Rule of Three (ART): A statistical specification with more than three explanatory variables is meaningless.</p>
<p>ART may sound draconian, but in fact, it is no more than sound science. With more than three independent variables, no one can do the careful data analysis to ensure that the model specification is accurate and that the assumptions fit as well as the researcher claims.</p>
