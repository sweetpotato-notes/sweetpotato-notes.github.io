        <p>The implication of operationalism to which I wish to draw attention is an extremely simple one. For over a century economists, whether of the ‘mathematical’ school or not, have made increasing use of functional relationships between two or more economic variables, in either geometric or algebraic form. Restricting ourselves to functional relationships among observable variables, the question arises: What, if any, is the operational significance of such functions? The answer is that the use of such functions must be interpreted as hypothesizing that they are stable, if they are to have operational significance. The interpretation is logically necessary and sufficient for these functions to have operational meaning. These functions, if interpreted in this way, are operational hypotheses, while, if not interpreted in this way, they cannot be said to have any relation to possible observed experience.</p>
<p>Any observed shifts in a function we may classify into two categories. They may be predictable because the theory in which they are used hypothesizes that they are related to one or more observable variables. The theory is then restricted to situations in which these disturbing variables and therefore the functions involved, do not shift. Or a new function can be derived including these disturbing variables, and this new function can then be hypothesized as stable. On the other hand, the shifts may be unpredictable. Shifts in this second category may be classified in turn into groups, depending upon whether we think of them as being caused (a) by observable variables that are not known, at the moment, to have any relation to the original dependent variables or (b) by factors that are in principle unobervable, such as ‘tastes.’ Since the possibility of a scientific economics rests, to a large extent, upon the possibility of some stability in functional relationships, we naturally look for further explanatory, observable variables. It is well to remember, however, that this search may prove fruitless.</p>
<p>The functions in the first category, which shift predictably, are, in effect, stable functions. In the second category, that of unpredictable shifts, we have, for the time being, at least, genuinely unstable functions. The methodological argument of this paper is that all economic theories using functions, if they are to be operational, must be interpreted as hypothesizing that these functions are stable in this sense (including, that is, predictable shifts). If a function shifts unpredictably – that is, fails to predict accurately – the hypothesis is refuted. In what follows, I shall use ‘stable’ and ‘unstable’ in this way.</p>
<p>For the most part, economic theories have made use of ‘exact’ functions, which indicate a precise value for the dependent variable for any given value or values for one or more independent varibles. In economics, as in any other empirical science, observations that lie precisely on the curve are infrequent. In some disciplines from a precise fit are insignificant, but they seldom are in economics. This naturall suggests that the deviations may be distributed in a determinate way, so that the functions can be formulated stochastically. For each value of the independent variable(s) a probability distribution rather than a precise value is hypothesized for the dependent variable. In this case we hypothesize a stable stochastic function and make a precise statement, not about the dependent variable but about the parameters describing the probability distribution. We cannot, therefore, avoid the problem of stability in this way, and my general argument applies likewise to probabilistic propositions.</p>
<p>In this section I shall consider to what extent this stability implication of operationalism is recognized implicitly or explicitly in current practice. Clearly, the necessity of the hypothesis of stability is recognized, at least implicitly, by anyone attempting to derive functional relationships statistically. It is recognized less frequently by those concerned with policy decisions that any postulated function that is to be used in such decisions must be stable. The Keynesian theory is widely regarded as possessing advantages over quantity theories of income determination to the extent that the propensity to consume is more stable than the fraction of an individual’s income which he wishes to hold in the form of money. It has recently been recognized that the significance of welfare economics – of even the simpliest proposition concerning the possibilities of mutual benefit through exchange – depends, among other things, upon the hypothesis that preference curves do not shift. Since the function of methodological analysis is to retionalize the existing practices of a science (rather than to discover new ones), some recognition of operationalism must be implicit in the practice of a great deal of economics, or there would be prima facie grounds for viewing it with suspicion. The qualifications I have make concerning the notion of a stable economic function are easily applied to most economic theories, and it is reasonable to suppose that most economists, if pressed, would apply them to theories about the observable world.</p>
<p>In the case of functions more compliated than constants of proportionality, the recognition of the hypothesis of stability is easier to overlook. In Keynes’s formal statement of the consumption function no mention is made of stability. It is interesting to note, however, that he went on to argue that ‘at least in the short run’ the propensity to consume is ‘fairly’ stable. On the other hand, Keynes and his followers consider both the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital and the liquidity-preference functions to be very unstable. If, then, the consumption function is stable (especially in its recent formulations), then a simple Keynesian theory, consisting of the consumption expenditure as a constant, is not formally valid and fruitful but empirically valid and fruitful. On the other hand, if the liquidity-preference function and the marginal efficiency of capital schedule are unstable, then the general theory of employment as a whole is false. For that theory, consisting of the three functions plus the ‘real’ quantity of money, amounts to a hypothesis of a stable functional relationship (not, of course, one of proportionality) between the quantity of money and the national income, which, according to Keynesians, does not exist.</p>
<p>From the point of view of this paper, this evaluation is deficient because the general-equilibrium theory is, in all likelihood, simply false. For, if the general-equilibrium system is a ‘fundamental discovery’ about human behavoir, it is one because it hypothesizes, with some validity, that a very large number of functions embodying the preferences of the community for goods and for the services of factors of production are stable. Since this is, to say the least, somewhat implausible, the theory is naturally inapplicable to the real world. The Marshallian apparatus of demand and supply, on the other hand, may be applied to a particular industry, where, from general knowledge of the situation, it may be plausible to hypothesize the stability of one or two functions, even in the fairly long run. At any rate, the functions of partial equilibrium can be considered ‘tools of analysis,’ in that they provide appropriate initial questions to ask of the data concerning the stability of the functions themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, the stability implication of operationalism may also be used in interpreting the long-standing controversy between economic theorists, particularly mathematical theorists, and their critics. Most of these critics are united in their skepticism concerning deductive methods or formal logic in economics. To take only two prominent examples, Williams in his presidential address before the American Economic Association refers repeatedly to the ‘striving for logical consistency’ that makes theory ‘increasingly remote from reality.’ Another instance is Marshall’s well-known comment on the role of deductive logic: ‘It is obvious that there is no room in economics for long trains of deductive reasoning.’</p>
