        <p>It aims to give a picture of the adjustments between agriculture and industry during the process of industrialization. The emphasis, however, will be laid upon the adjustments in agriculture and its adaptation to change.<br>There are several sets of questions with which this study particularly attempts to deal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is industrial development a necessary or a sufficient condition for agricultural reform in a densely populated rural region, or vice versa?<br>In order to answer this question, the process of industrialization in general and the basic factors affecting it will be studied. The interdependence of agriculture and industry and the mutual effects of industrial and agricultural developments will be emphasized and analyzed.</li>
<li>Is it possible to maintain a balance between agriculture and industry within a given country? If it is, how? If not, why? Is there a third answer?</li>
<li>Is it possible to maintain harmonies and mutually beneficial relations between countries primarily agricultural and those essentially industrial? If, in an agricultural country, the process of industrialization sets in, what are the possible effects of this on the countries already highly industrialized?<br>To answer these questions requires a study of trade and capital movement between agricultural and industrial countries.</li>
<li>Keeping in mind all the implications and complications raised above, what are the particularly pressing problems which would most probably confront an agricultural country during its process of industrialization?</li>
</ol>
<p>The general equilibrium approach provides no place for an industry.<br>The general equilibrium approach assumes ‘perfect competition’, and in the theory of production it assumes ‘fixed’ technological coefficients of production. Their analysis is entirely ‘static’.</p>
<p> The partial equilibrium approach (or the Marshallian type of analysis) differs from the general equilibrium approach (or the Walrasian type of analysis) in that, for a given instant (or period) of time, it confines itself to the study of one phenomenon, or the relationship between two phenomena, while it assumes that other phenomena remain constant, using the famous phrase of ‘other things being equal’.</p>
<p>The theory of imperfect or monopolistic competition modifies the classical theories in two ways.<br>First, it introduces the theory of the firm in addition to that of the group or the industry, which has constituted the main skeleton of the Marshallian analysis.<br>In the second place, the theory replaces the assumption of perfect or pure competition by one of imperfect or monopolistic competition. While perfect competition may serve as an ideal case in which the equilibrium analysis is especially useful, the theory of imperfect competition is justified in claiming to be more realistic and under its analysis the perfect competition would be treated as a special case.<br>But it is to be pointed out that under imperfect and monopolistic competition the use of equilibrium analysis is greatly limited. Because of the genetic characteristics, it is impossible to have a stable equilibrium either for a firm or for a group (industry).<br>In spite of these limitations, the theory of imperfect competition would still find valuable application to the present study.</p>
<p>All agricultural or rural markets are in no way free from special institutional restraints, nor from geographical and physical hindrances. In other words, prices and the mobility of resources are far from being unrestricted. Furthermore, the farm or rural family as an economic unit does not possess complete knowledge, and is, in most cases, much less favorably informed of the market news than the economic units in an urban area. The market from that we really have in a rural community is usually either a ‘monopsony’ or an ‘oligopsony’. As to the production structure, it is nothing new to say that response of farmers or farms to changes in prices is very slow and in some cases even nil.</p>
<p>Any analysis, either purely theoretical or historical, of the functional relationship between agriculture and industry requires an application of the theory of imperfect competition if the results are to be in accord with what has happened in the economic society and what would most likely happen under the present economic system.</p>
<p>The limitations of the aggregative equilibrium approach as applied to the present study would be greater than has been stated by Schumpeter in dealing with business cycles as quoted in the above paragraph. This is because any dealing with the characteristics of an industry or the relations between two industries would lose its significance in dealing only with total output and total income and their relations to quantity of money, rate of interest, and price level. The latter would in general give us no information about the former.</p>
<p>The new approach (location theory) does in no way rely on mathematical treatment. This is because the mathematical treatment would have to be based on the assumption that economic activity takes place upon a completely undifferentiated plane surface, which, by no means, fits the reality.<br>The central thesis of the new approach may be stated thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is desirable to direct our interest in the first instance towards the broader aspect of the developing patterns of population density.</li>
<li>It is desirable to study the relations of these patterns to localized resources and to the significance that regional resources possess under technological conditions of each historical period.</li>
<li>It is necessary also to recognize explicitly the significance of accessibility of resource deposits to long-distance trade.</li>
<li>The study of differences in accessibility requires careful analysis of the topography of the primary regions of the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>The usefulness of the location theory for our present study lies not only in that it brings into the pricture the locational aspect of the problem, but also in that, as has been undertaken by the dynamic approach of the theory, it points out the changes of the basic locational factor from one historical period to another, and upon this factor other economic activities are to be focused.</p>
<p>With the new approach of the location theory – or it may be called ‘the general and dynamic location theory’ – there is intrinsically no need for making a distinction between agricultural and industrial location. The new approach emphasizes in general the population settlement, utilization (and limitation) of resources, and the working relationship of the two. Relations of agriculture to industry during the process of industrialization, therefore, can be explained by that approach only in general terms, but not in specific details. </p>
<p>As Lionel Robbins has brilliantly remarked:<br>in the realm of Applied Economics, some division of labour is essential, and theory cannot be fruitfully applied to the interpretation of concrete situations unless it is informed continually of the changing background of the facts of particular industires. But, as experience shows, sectional investigations conducted in isolation are exposed to very grave dangers. If continual vigilance is not exercised they tend to the gradual replacement of economic by technological interests. The focus of attention becomes shifted, and a body of generalizations which have only technical significance comes to masquerade as Economics. And this is fatal. For, since the scarcity of means is relative to ‘all’ ends, it follows that an adequate view of the influences governing social relationships in their economic aspects can only be obtained by viewing the economic system as a whole. The raison detre, indeed, is the existence of other industries, and their fortunes can only be understood in relation to the whole network of economic relationships. It follows, therefore, that studies which are exclusively devoted to one industry or occupation are continually exposed to the danger of losing touch with the essentials. Their attention may be supposed to be directed to the study of prices and costs, but they tend continually to degenerate either into mere accountancy or into amateur technology. The existence of this danger is no ground for dispensing with this kind of investigation. But it is fundamental that its existence should be clearly recognized. Here, as elsewhere, it is the preservation of a proper balance which is important.</p>
<p>That tool has been applied by C. W. Wright to the study of the economic development of the United States. In his analysis of the main factors which underlie the transformation of American manufacturing, Wright stresses three sets as fundamental:<br>(1) the comparative cost of the main factors of production;<br>(2) transportation and related costs as limiting the area within which exchange based on differences in comparative costs could take place;<br>(3) the group of artificial factors, based mainly on legislation, tending to restrict or to stimulate manufacturing development.</p>
<p>If the natural growth of population and the occupational shift occur at the same time, the problem of food supply appears to be essentially the same. If we assume that there are no changes in taste and in farm technology, the means to meet the deficiency in food supply would consist of any of the following three methods:<br>extensive cultivation (more land),<br>intensive cultivation (more labor on the same land),<br>or import from outside (interregional trade);<br>or a combination of any two, or of all three of them.</p>
<p>In an agricultural country, or in a country during the stage in which agricultural production is of primary importance and a larger proportion of the people are rural, the distribution of population is determined mainly by food production.</p>
<p>Thus, ‘prior to the eighteenth century, export industry was located in large measure in regions of cheap food production or in regions where food was cheap by reason of easy transport conditions.’</p>
<p>From this it is clear that for any country, before industrial revolution took place, food was the main factor for the localization of all economic activities – industrial, commercial, or otherwise. As soon as industrialization in a country is appreciably under way, food resources begin to have less importance as a locational factor.</p>
<p>The relationship among the three factors – price elasticity of demand, income elasticity of demand, and elasticity of substitution – is very well described by Hick’s and Allen’s simple and standard formula, stating that the price elasticity of demand is a weighted average of the income elasticity of demand and the elasticity of substitution.</p>
<p>But history has shown that progress in farm technology always goes side by side with industrial development. The question then becomes one of the difference in the rate of progress between farm technology and industrial development.</p>
<p>The acceleration principle has been widely used for describing and explaining business cycles. As it has been well elaborated by Haberler, the principle states that “Changes in demand for, and production of, finished goods and services tend to give rise to much greater changes in the demand for, and production of, those producers’ goods which are used for their production.”</p>
<p>From some statistical data of longer periods several conclusions about the relationship may be drawn. First, both the agricultural and industrial prices have the same trend.<br>Second, the amplitude of change in agricultural prices is always greater than in industrial prices. This is the essence of the acceleration principle.<br>Finally, there is a lag of one, two, or three years in the changes of agricultural prices behind the changes of industrial prices.<br>These three – same trend, the accelerating effect, and a lag in change – are the main features pertaining to production of any two successive stages which are far enough apart to be distinguished from one another. In a way, it may be described as the relationship between demand (industry) and the derived demand (agriculture).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we, in explaining economic progress and cyclical fluctuations under the modern capitalistic system, adopt a view that only the enterprising spirit and technology are generating factors, while the institutional forms, such as production structure and trade organizations, are at most modifying and shaping factors, the present controversy is almost entirely irrelevant.</p>
<p>The optimum population is that population which, with given amountsof other factors (including land, productive technique, capital, and organization), will produce the ‘maximum product.’ Any increase or decrease of the population above or below that size will diminish the product. This optimum, in contrast with the one proposed by J. S. Mill, is not a size fixed for all time: it is determined only by reference to all the other data of the economic system.</p>
<p>The basic reason for occupational shifts, as revealed in the labor transfer from agriculture to other production fields, may be found in the differences of the per-capita monetary returns. While it is difficult to make any accurate calculation concerning the incomes derived from agriculture, it seems safe to say that, excluding large farmers in the newer countries, planatation owners in colonial countries, and a few large European farmers – these form only a very small proportion of the total number of farmers – the actual return per capita from farming is smaller than that derived from industrial, commercial, and professional occupations. Such a difference or gap becomes greater when industrial and commercial expansion is on the way, especially during early stages of industrialization.</p>
<p>Such a type of occupational shift – a permanent or long-run transfer from agriculture to other production fields – is among the main features that characterize the process of industrialization.</p>
<p>But, in the last analysis, in a society where industrialization has already begun, power resources, of which coal is most representative, are to be regarded as the main factor in the localization of economic activities. This is because in modern society some industries which must use coal as power have become so predominant that other economic activities must be accordingly adjusted and reoriented. In this case, labor as a social factor of production must submit to the power resoruces which are geographically localized.</p>
<p>Therefore, industrialization is, in a way, a process in which scales and ranges of increasing returns are continuously created, and in due time respectively prolonged and enlarged.</p>
<p>There is a well-known list, suggested by Frank H. Knight, to cover the ‘factor in regard to which change or the possibility of change must be studied.’ These factors are the data for economic theory and are the objects of study for the theory of economic development. The list includes the following factors or independent variables.</p>
<ol>
<li>The population, numbernd composition.</li>
<li>The tastes and dispositions of the people.</li>
<li>The amounts and kinds of production capacities in existence, including<br>a) Personal powers<br>b) Material agents</li>
<li>The distribution of ownership of these, including all rights of control by persons over persons or things.</li>
<li>Geographic distribution of people and things.</li>
<li>The state of the arts; the whole situation as to science, education, technology, social organization, etc.<br>There is no reason to assume that these factors or variables are entirely independent of any change in other factors or variables. In a longer run, these independent variables may also become dependent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us take tastes as an example. According to Roll, there are three kinds of changes in tastes or consumers’ preference The first are ‘autonomous’ changes, the causes of which cannot be easily ascertained; the second are ‘repercussive’ changes, which are themselves the results of changes in population, capital, productivity, and so on; and, finally, there are changes in tastes which are deliberately brought about; they are ‘induced.’ It is only the first kind of changes that can claim to be independent.</p>
<p>If this argument is carried too far, it will lead to a situation where none of the factors in economic society can be taken as independent, because all factors are, in one way or another, interdependent and interacting. Thus a point must be found on which to stop and stand. In order to build a theory or a systematic argument to explain economic phenomena so complicated, especially because the complexity increases as the period or process of evolution is further prolonged, the concepts of ‘partial’ interdependence and ‘relative’ continuity have to be used instead of the general and the absolute ones.</p>
<p>After this reclassification, the following four fundamental factors are obtained for explaining the process of industrial evolution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Population – number, composition, and geographical distribution</li>
<li>Resources or material agents – kinds, amounts, and geographical distribution</li>
<li>Social institutions – the distribution of ownership of productive agents, personal and material</li>
<li>Technology – emphasis to be laid on the application of inventions, while conditions of science, education, and social organization are considered outside the scope of present discussion.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship – changing the production function or applying a new production function.</li>
</ol>
<p>These five factors, to the present writer, are the most important ones in generating and shaping the process of industrial evolution. But their natures and influences are different, and can be further grouped into two classes. I consider entrepreneurship and technology as generating factors; resources, population, and social institutions as limitational factors.</p>
<p>But what we emphasize here is the ‘enterprising spirit’ which lies behind, and leads onward, the enterprising actions. Sombart has interpreted this spirit as a mental attitude which is dominated by the principles of acquisition, of competition, and of economic rationality. He considers the ‘enterprising spirit,’ together with ‘form’ (regulation and organization) and ‘technical methods’ as the three basic characteristics that constitute the essence of modern capitalism. Of these three, the aspect which he most strongly emphasizes is that of the enterprising spirit. As he said, ‘at different times different attitudes toward economic life have prevailed, and that it is the enterprising spirit which created a suitable form for itself and has thus created economic organization.’ This spirit is more than the ‘motive of maximizing profit’ which, together with the motive of maximizing satisfaction, makes a rational ‘economic man’ and constitutes one of the most fundamental assumptions in economic theory. The former is broader because it includes, most important, the spirit or the intention of ‘enterprising for enterprising itself,’ in addition to ‘enterprising for profit.’<br>The enterprising spirit is a fundamental generating factor for the rise and vigorous development of the so-called ‘commercial capitalism’ in the latter Middle Ages, the characteristics of which consist of adventurous undertakings in new territories, improvement of navigation and advance of commercial organization. These commercial changes that have broadened the market for industries to the greatest extent ever seen in history, together with the mechanical achievements (technological progress) that for the first time made themselves especially apparent at the end of the eighteenth century, have contributed most greatly to making the process of industrial revolution a reality.<br>Of course one must never fail to recognize that the interplay of several factors is in reality more essential than the acting of any factor alone. But this need not in any sense belittle the primary importance of the enterprising spirit in generating a process that let toward modern capitalism. I used to think that lack of such a spirit in Chinese tradition helped to explain why industrial revolution has not taken place spontaneously within the Chinese economy. In considering this particular problem, one must, of course, also take into account other factors, such as geographical situation, attitude toward scientific research, and government policies. It is to be noted, however, that the enterprising spirit itself is conditioned, or at least influenced, by cultural inheritance. It should also be recognized that only after technological progress has reached a certain stage can the spirit be fully expressed and magnified.</p>
<p>As Sombart has well said, what characterizes modern technique is that it is scientic. Science and technique are so closely related as to represent the theoretical and practical sides of the same movement. The medieval technique was on the one hand tranditional, as received from a master and handed down; on the other hand it was empirical, relying upon experience for instruction and not on objective scientific reasoning… Thus modern technique is both rational and scientific.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the labor-saving invention has been the more frequent in history; and, in early days of industrial revolution, it was the introduction of labor-saving machinery that aroused the antagonism of workers and their sympathizers.</p>
<p>As technological changes are introduced, limits as set by resources may be partially lifted, or may be shifted or changed to that of a different category. As a matter of fact, efforts of technology have been usually directed to overcoming the difficulties caused by the shortage or lack of certain materials. Crowded Europe has suffered from an inadequancy of raw materials. Her effort therefore, has to be concentrated upon exploiting to the fullest possible measure the resources which she does posses and upon finding substitutes for those which are lacking and which cannot be readily obtained from the outside. In other words, her effort has to be, in general, centered upon the invention of material-saving devices, as contrasted with the labor-saving devices of the United States. Progress in chemistry in Europe, especially in Germany, serves as a good illustration.</p>
<p>The rate of population growth, especially in the process of industrialization, is of interest because it fits into our dynamic analysis. From the experience of various industrialized countries, a pattern of the trend of population may be drawn. During the initial stage of industrialization, a rapid decline in the death rate takes place, making possible a huge expansion of population, and is followed in later stages by an accelerating decline of the birth rate, which in more advanced countries has reduced population growth with the imminent prospect of bringing it to an end.</p>
<p>Industrialization may be achieved under different patterns, or types, of forms, according to certain criteria we use for the classification. First of all, according to the amount of initiative taken by government and individual, industrializtion may be classified into three types:<br>(1) individual-or-private-initiated;<br>(2) government-initiated;<br>(3) jointly initiated.</p>
<p>It is more appropriate to call the process started under government initiative a revolution, because it is more sudden and phenomenal.</p>
<p>It is obvious that personal freedom, which includes freedom to move, freedom to buy and sell, and free choice of occupation, is an important condition for modern economic development characterized by the rise and expansion of modern capitalism.</p>
<p>But I want to stress the point that personal freedom is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for modern idustrial development.</p>
<p>The influences of war on economic expansion may be approached from three angles. First, war creates demand, and hence stimulates the introduction of new products and the use of substitutes which can be more advantageously produced at home. It stimulates employment, and presents a necessity for introducing technological changes, either labor-saving or material-saving. Finally, it helps wash of social reform regarding the distribution of income and the ownership of property. Thus, we may safely conclude that war is a stimulating factor for economic expansion, and provides favorable chances, of course for the victorious country only, to start and, if already started, to hasten the process of industrialization.</p>
<p>The process of industrialization is only another way of stating the sequence of technological changes in modern economic society.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the whole production structure of a society, the main characteristic of industrialization is the relative increase of capital goods and the relative decrease of consumption goods. In this sence, industrialization may be defined as ‘capitalization’ of production; in order words, production in a more roundabout way.</p>
<p>The fact that industrialization started often with textiles may be explained by the following reasons.<br>First, the elasticity of demand for clothing is greater than that for food, although both of them are inelastic (less than unity) in the modern concept. In the early period of industrialization, products of groups other than clothing and food were less known either owing to technical impossibility or because demand for them had not been created. Thus, the texitiles, either cotton, silk, or wool, which had long been the backbone of domestic industries, or industries under the ‘merchant-employer system,’ had the privilege and a more favorable chance of being the first to undergo the process of industrial transformation.<br>Secondly, form the location point of view, food crops are, to a large extent, ubiquitous, while cotton, silk, and wool are mostly localized. Trade of localized products is bound to be more frequent, and its amount greater. It need not be said that trade gives stimulation to production.<br>Also, the mobility of texitile goods is much higher than that of food products because of a lesser extent of bulkiness and perishability. The mobility of the latter was very limited before modern storage and the refrigeration system came into use.<br>Finally, from the technical point of view, the textile industries require more skill in production, and hence need labor training more than many other industries. The textile industries need laborers not only of greater skill, but also in a larger amount, so far as the internal production structure is concerned. such a technical requirement gives the textiles an advantage, and at the same time creates a necessity that labor surplus in rural areas during the initial period of industrialization be absorbed.<br>Furthermore, the textile industries, at least compared with food industries, are more subject to specialization, and hence to concentration, which means large production in one process. This further indicates that they are more suitable for modern organization.<br>The mechanical inventions in the textiles, which themselves have been conditioned by the demand and economic situation, have made it possible for the textile industries to expand and develop.</p>
<p>Failure to express the qualitative side of the technological changes involved in an evolutionary process is an inherent defect and hence a serious limitation to the method of quantitative approach.</p>
<p>This leads to the conclusion that the countries in which industrialization started the latest are, in general, those in which the speed is the greatest. This is so because countries begining the process of industrialization later usually have greater advantages of introducing the most up-to-date technology.</p>
<p>Industrialization as a process characterized by technological changes has three obvious effects: first, it changes the proportions of the factors; second, it tends to reduce the price of capital; and third, it provides an ever increasingly favorable condition for the substitution of capital for labor. On the whole, these effects will tend to raise capital’s elasticity of substitution.</p>
<p>The difference in the rate of growth in the fields under conparison is chiefly due to the difference in the income elasticity of demand for their products and services and also due to their various degrees of expandibility of production structure as limited by the technological factors.</p>
<p>The final outcome depends on how the marginal productivity of the given factor is affected. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed by Hicks that only two factors, labor and capital, are used in producing a given commodity. Accordingly, improved techniques which affect both absolute and relative shares of the total product limited to the two factors may be calssified as labor-saving, capital-saving, or nuetral. Labor-saving inventions are those which increase the marginal product of capital more than they increase the marginal product of labor. Conversely, capital-saving inventions increase the marginal product of capital less than that of labor. A neutral invention means that the marginal productivities of the two factors are increased in the same proportion.<br>Hick’s analysis is based on two assumptions. One is that in each case the system is in equilibrium and the other is that he ignores completely the possibility of increasing returns. These two assumptions limit, to a great extent, the applicability of his theory to an evolutionary process such as industrialization. But the general principles remain valid and, if supported by empirical verification, may prove useful in suggesting the general direction of the relative importance of labor, or of any other factor of production, as a consequence of technological change.</p>
<p>Once capital, especially in the form of machinery, is invested or installed, there will be a momentum set for its further expansion. Such a self-generating force lies intrinsically in part in the capitalist economic system.</p>
<p>From the above four propositions, it can be clearly seen that in an expansionist economy, the elasticity of demand for labor in industry is on the whole greater than that in agriculture, even given a state of prospective technology. This is so for the following reaosns.<br>First, the elasticity of demand for industrial goods is in general much greater than the elasticity of demand for agricultural goods of which most are food products.<br>Secondly, substitution is more available in industry than in agriculture.<br>Thirdly, considering the fact that the proportion of labor cost in total cost is usually smaller in industry than in agriculture, it may be stated that the demand for labor by industry is less elastic in the aspect. But we also know that the proportions of the factors of production are more easily subject to alteration in industry than in agriculture where land plays a major and rigid role. This would offset, though in varied degrees, the factor just considered.<br>Finally, the supply of other factors is in general more elastic in industry than in agriculture, especially, as we have just pointed out, because land is such an important and rigid factor in agricultural production.</p>
<p>The interregional barriers and poor transportation facilities wihtin China constitute another group of obstacles that have made it very difficult for the free movement of commodities and the factors of production.</p>
<p>Industrialization, as we noted in Chapter III, may simply be called the process of ‘capitalization,’ that is, the process in which widening and deepening of capital are taking place. That process involves, of course, technological changes. Taking the world as a whole, economic development is of different degrees in different countries. There is a natural tendency for the capital to flow from the regions or countries where the marginal producticity of capital is relatively lower to those places where it is higher, if the prospective returns are great enough to compensate for the risk of investment in addition to the transfer cost incurred.</p>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The introduction to this book presented four main problems for analysis. Now, in the light of the foregoing chapters, I shall attempt to answer these major questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is industrial development a necessary or a sufficient condition for agricultural reform in a densely populated rural region, or vice versa?</li>
<li>Is it possible to maintain a balance between agriculture and industry within a given country?</li>
<li>Is it possible to maintain harmonies and mutually beneficial relations between countries primarily agricultural and those essentially industrial, and if, in an agricultural country, the process of industrialization sets in, what are the possible effects of this on the countries already highly industrialized?</li>
<li><p>What are the problems which would most probably confront an agricultural country like China during its process of industrialization?</p>
</li>
<li><p>As to the first of these problems, it may be concluded that industrial development is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for agricultural reform and improvement, if by agricultural reform and improvement we mean mechanization in agriculture and the large-scale organization of farm enerprises.<br>Industrial development is a necessary condition because farm machinery, chemical fertilizers, and other equipment and instruments necessary for modern farming have to be supplied by modern industry. Moreover, only an appreciable rise of people’s income which is to be secured from industrial and commercial expansion can raise, though at a decreasing rate, the demand for farm products and stimulate the improvements in agriculture.<br>But industrial development alone cannot sufficiently induce agricultural reform. Other conditions have to be provided simultaneously or even in advance if agricultural reform and improvement are to be effectively carried out. Among the other conditions the most important are improvements in transport, consolidation of farms, and legal regulations relating to the redistribution of land which will make the large-scale farm organization a reality.<br>Historically it has been shown that among the highly industrialized countries, those which have a higher degree of mechanization in agriculture are also those which have a greater size of farm. Of this group we may mention the United States, Australia, Great Britain, and Soviet Russia. In these countries, industrial development has contributed greatly to agricultural modernization.<br>But other necessary conditions for large-scale and scientific farming should also be recognized. Australia and the United States are new countries in which the institutional obstacles to large-scale farming are much smaller than those in old countries. In Great Britain the system of primogeniture has been among the chief factors keeping the farm holdings from further division. The enclosure movement, twice seen in her history, was as significant as commercial and industrialexpansion in stimulating and facilitating the agriclutural reform and improvement. Soviet Russia has removed all the institutional obstacles to farm reorganization by revolution and thus paved the way for the establishment of state and collective farms.<br>On the other hand, there are several industrialized countries whose agriculture is not highly mechanized partially because of the institutional restrictions standing in the way of farm consolidation and land redistribution.<br>Of this group Japan, Germany, France, and Belgium may be mentioned. Their agricultural improvements have been confined largely to application of chemical fertilizers and adoption of crop rotation and other new farming methods rather than introduction of farm machinery. The high density of population in these countries is also among the serious obstacles. The same explanation may apply to Denmark, though her industrial production is far less important than agricultural.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Answers to the second question, that is, whether in a given country it is possible to maintain a balance between agriculture and industry, depend, first of all, on the concept given to the term ‘balance’.<br>It may be stated in general that in an evolutionary process like industrialization, this question really occupies no place because there is no such thing as balance if used in its genuine sense. Theoretically, we should admit that given a state of technology there should be an optimum point of adjustment between agriculture and industry. This optimum point may be called ‘balance’ or ‘point approaching balance.’ Thus in our evolutionary process, there will be, also theoretically, a series of such points which construct an irregular curve of adjustments between agriculture and industry. However, in reality such optimum points may never be reached. Thus no balance or curve of balance between agriculture and industry can be really attained.<br>Moreover, comparing the two production fields under inquiry, we may say that, while the expansion of agriculture is somehow limited, the expansion of industry is almost indifinite. In an expansionist economy, if given the rate of population growth and the possible change in the size and distribution of income, increase and shifts in the demand for food can, to a large extent, be ascertained. This means that the function of agriculture in supplying food is estimable even in a changing economy. But its function of supplying raw materials cannot be definitely predicted, and it depends in great measure upon the expansion of industry and the development of synthetic products as substitutes. On the whole, the expansion of agriculture can be more or less estimated because supply of food constitutes overwhelmingly its major function.<br>The case is entirely different with industry. There the creation of new products and their expansion are so varied and uncertain as to be in no way predictable. Therefore, in a real changing world, it is impossible to conceive any balance between agriculture and industry, when one of them is almost completely unknown.<br>But the balance between agriculture and industry may be expressed in terms other than the functions performed. It may be measured in terms of national product or national income, or in terms of working population. Neither method is satisfactory, owing to the defects inherent in the quantitative analysis which in no way can express adequately the qualitative changes. Nevertheless, they are the only measures available at the present stage. For this reason, we have employed them in Chapters II and IV to indicate the change of the place of agriculture in relation to industry. The concept of balance in terms of working population has long been emphasized because after all economics is a human science, dealing with the material well-being of mankind. No matter what measure is employed, it has been shown that the relative importance of agriculture in the whole economy has been on the decrease in an expansion process of economic evolution. It is the main due to the relatively lower income-elasticity of demand for farm products. This, however, does not mean that agriculture itself has been declining in the absolute sense. On the contrary, agricultural production has been expanding rapidly since industrialization was first introduced, taking in view the world economy as a whole. Only the rate of expansion is smaller in agriculture than in industry. Thus even in a highly industrialized country that absolute number of working population engaged in agriculture and absolute amount of agricultural production may not decrease at all.</p>

<li><p>The question as to whether it is possible to maintain harmonious and mutually beneficial relations between countries primarily agricultural and those predominantly industrial may be answered from an examination of the following two aspects.<br>In the first place, barring the political consideration, the interdependence between the economic activities performed by an agricultural country and those by an industrial country is no less close and profound than the interdependence of economic activities between agriculture and industry within a country. Here there are two points to be considered. On the one hand, the differences in physical factors as indicated by climate and resources and differences in cultural background as revealed in labor skill are greater between countries than within them. Thus the division in production on the international level seems to have a greater range and a higher degree than on the national scale. On the other hand, the necessity of international division of labor is partially offset by the attempt of attaining self-sufficiency as revealed in national economic policies. This attempt was chiefly responsible for the parallel movement in recent decades, that is, the ‘agrarianization’ of industrial countries and the ‘industrialization’ of agricultural countries, the first being especially reactionary and contrary to the trend of economic evolution. These two factors, physical and political, tend always to work in the opposite direction.<br>In the second place, if we approach the problem from a long run point of view and use the concept of industrialization as given in this analysis, then industrialization in agricultural countries would have to be viewed as the inevitable result of beneficial both to the industrializing countries and to those already highly industrialized. It will be so because it will raise the productivitynd the income level of the countries newly under industrialization, and, in turn, raise their marginal propensity to import which will profit the old industrial countries. But, for these benefits, some price must be paid. Industrialization in an agricultural country will undoubtedly have competitive effects on some industries in the old countries. The new industrial country may first reduce some of her imports from the old ones, and later compete with them in a third market. It will compel the old industrial countries to make adjustments in production in one way or another in order to meet the changed situation. To what extent the old industrial countries will benefit from the industrialization of an agricultural country depends in great measure upon its ability to make the adjustments. The adverse effects of this kind and their impact on the adjustments are essentially not very different from those necessarily resulting in the internal economic structure of the agricultural country newly under industrialization.</p>

<li><p>In Chapter VI, I attempted to describe and appraise the possible implications and complications raised by the industrialization of an agricultural country. We may be now in a better position to understand the problems of China’s industrialization. The purposes and the scope of this essay do not permit any detailed inquiry into the problem, in Chapter VI only a brief analysis has been made of the role that agriculture will play and the possible adjustments to be made in agriculture during the process of industrialization.<br>Several points pertaining to the case of China may be stated as conclusions.<br>First, it may be said that stimulus for industrialization must be found in sources other than agriculture. This means that agriculture will play only a passive role in the coming process of economic transformation.<br>Second, it has been made evident that industrial development is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for agricultural reform and improvement. This is due, in the main, to the characteristics of the production structure of the fields. The change of the strategical production functions is made possible only when industrial development gets under way. These two may, to a large extent, be identified. The assertion that agriculture may alone develop without relying on industry does not recognize this strategical point.<br>Third, consolidation of farms which presupposes a drastic policy of land reform and improvement is considered most important in addition to the stimulus and support to be received from industrial development.<br>Finally, industrialization of China will undoubtedly have some competitive effects on the old industrial countries in some production lines, but these effects will not be felt for a long period to come. Moreover, they will be partially offset by the increase of the purchasing power of the Chinese people. And if the old industrial countries make efforts to adjust their production accordingly and simultaneously, the industrialization of China and other agricultural countries will lead to a new line of international division of labor which will in the long run prove beneficial both to the agricultural and to the industrial countries. </p>
