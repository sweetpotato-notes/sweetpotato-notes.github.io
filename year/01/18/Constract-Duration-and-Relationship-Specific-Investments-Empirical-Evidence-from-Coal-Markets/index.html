        <p>This paper seeks to test empirically the importance of relationship-specific investments in determining the duration of coal contracts negotiatied between coal suppliers and electric utilities.</p>
<p>Coal market transactions are interesting to focus on because there is considerable variation in the duration and structure of vertical relationships between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>The empirical results reported below provide strong support for the hypothesis that buyers and sellers make longer ex ante commitments to the terms of future trade, and rely less on repeated negotiations over time, when relationship-specific investments are more important.</p>
<p>The reliance on relationship-specific investments to support cost-minimizing exchange is frequently advanced as an important factor explaining why we observe the use of long-term contracts that establish the terms and conditions of repeated transactions between two parties ex ante. According to transactions cost theory, when exchange involves significant investments in relationship-specific capital, an exchange relationship that relies on repeated bargaining is unattractive. Once the investments are sunk in anticipation of performance, ‘hold-up’ or ‘opportunism’ incentives are created ex post which, if mechanisms cannot be designed to mitigate the parties’ ability to act on these incentives, could make a socially cost-minimizing transaction privately unattractive at the contract execution stage. A long-term contract that specifies the terms and conditions for some set of future transactions ex ante, provides a vehicle for guarding against ex post performance problem.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that the more important are relationship-specific investments, the longer will be the period of time (or number of discrete transactions) over which the parties will establish the terms of trade ex ante by contract. I therefore expect to observe that the variation in the agreed upon duration of contractual commitments is directly related to variations in the importance of relationship-specific investments.</p>
<p>To summarize, if variations in the importance of relationship-specific investments do in fact lead to variations in the extent to which the parties precommit to the terms of future trade ex ante, I expect to find that the duration of contractual relationships specified at the contract execution stage will vary systematically with three primary observable characteristics of coal supply transactions. First, whether the plant taking the coal is a mine-mouth plant or not. I expect to observe longer-term contracts negotiated for mine-mouth plants. Second, with the region of the country in which the coal is produced. I expect the western region to have the longest contracts and the eastern region the shortest with the midwestern region having contracts with prespecified durations the lie in between. Third, with the annual quantity of coal contracted for. I expect that coal supply arrangements involving large annual quantity commitments will be supported by longer contracts than supply arrangements involving smaller quantities of coal.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper has been to examine empirically hypotheses about the relationship between the duration of coal contracts and the presence of the three types of relationship specific investments discussed by Williamson (1983). I argue that as relationship-specific investments become more important, the parties will find it advantageous to rely on longer-term contracts that specify the terms and conditions of repeated transactions ex ante, rather than relying on repeated bargaining. I make use of a large sample of coal contracts to examine this hypothesis. The empirical results obtained provide fairly strong support for this hypothesis. They are quite robust to alternative model specifications, samples, and estimating techniques. The results therefore provide additional empirical support for the view that the structure of vertical relationships between buyers and sellers is strongly affected by variations in the importance of relationship-specific investments.</p>
