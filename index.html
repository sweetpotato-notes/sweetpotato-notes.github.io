            <p>First, to clear the ground, a brief statement is given of a generally ignored aspect of ‘profit maximization,’ that is, where foresight is uncertain, ‘profit maximization’ is meaningless as a guide to specifiable action.</p>
<p>Adaptive, imitative, and trial-and-error behavior in the pursuit of ‘positive profits’ is utilized rather than its sharp contrast, the pursuit of ‘maximized profits’.</p>
<p>Uncertainty arises from at least two sources: imperfect foresight and human inability to solve complex problems containing a host of variables even when an optimum is definable.</p>
<p>The only way to make ‘profit maximization’ a specifically meaningful action is to postulate a model containing certainty.</p>
<p>This is the criterion by which the economic system selects survivors: those who realizes positive profits are the survivors; those who suffer losses disappear.</p>
<p>Also, the greater the uncertainties of the world, the greater is the possibility that profits would go to venturesome and lucky rather than to logical, careful, fact-gathering individuals.</p>
<p>Among all competitors, those whose particular conditions happen to be the most appropriate of those offered to the economic system for testing and adoption will be ‘selected’ as survivors.</p>
<p>A second element is the ability to adapt one’s self b various methods to an appropriate situation.</p>
<p>Less appropriately acting organisms of the same general class having lower probabilities of survival will find survival difficult.</p>
<p>For example, the long lives and disparate sizes of business firms and hereditary fortunes may seem to be reliable evidence of consistent foresighted motivation and nonrandom behavior.</p>
<p>Thus individual random behavior does not eliminate the likelihood of observing ‘appropriate’ decisions.</p>
<p>Even if environmental conditions cannot be forecast, the economist can compare for given alternative potential situations the types of behavior that would have higher probability of viability or adoption.</p>
<p>Empirical investigations via questionnaire methods, so far used, are incapable of evaluating the validity of marginal productivity analysis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, failure or success often reflects the willingness to depart from rules when conditions have changed; what counts, then, is not only imitative behavior but the willingness to abandon it at the ‘right’ time and cirmstances.</p>
<p>The economic counterparts of genetic heredity, mutations, and natural selection are imitation, innovation, and positive profits.</p>
<p>What really counts is the various actions actually tried, for it is from these that ‘success’ is selected, not from some set of perfect actions.</p>
<p>The formalization of this aproach awaits the marriage of the theory of stochastic processes and economics – two fields of thought admirably suited for union. </p>
<p>It is conjectured that the suggested modification is applicable to a wide class of events and is worth attempts at empirical verification. </p>

            <p>Delegates from forty-four nations met in the New Hampshire resort of Bretton Woods in July 1944 to construct the postwar international economic order.<br>Their objective was to avoid the upheavals of the last years of the Gold Standard and of the Great Depression.<br>They agreed that achieving this goal required:<br>1) fixed, but occasionally adjustable, exchange rates;<br>2) liberalization of international trade but not capital flows;<br>3) enlarged scope for national monetary and fiscal policies;<br>4) and enhanced cooperation through two new international agencies, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (which came to be known as the World Bank).</p>
<p>A central tenet of economics holds that when it comes to the welfare of the poor, direct cash grants are more effective than subsidies on specific consumer goods.</p>
<p>Models are both economics’ strength and its Achilles’ heel; they are also what make economics a science—not a science like quantum physics or molecular biology, but a science nonetheless.</p>
<p>The diversity of models in economics is the necessary counterpart to the flexibility of the social world. Different social settings require different models. Economists are unlikely ever to uncover universal, general-purpose models.</p>
<p>They have to select their models carefully as circumstances change, or as they turn their gaze from one setting to another. They need to learn how to shift among different models more fluidly.</p>
<p>Each of these criticisms derives in large part from a failure to recognize that economics is, in fact, a collection of diverse models that do not have a particular ideological bent or lead to a unique conclusion.</p>
<p>The term “economics” has come to be used in two different ways.<br>One definition focuses on the substantive domain of study; in this interpretation, economics is a social science devoted to understanding how the economy works.<br>The second definition focuses on methods: economics is a way of doing social science, using particular tools. In this interpretation the discipline is associated with an apparatus of formal modeling and statistical analysis rather than particular hypotheses or theories about the economy.</p>
<p>The possibilities of social life are too diverse to be squeezed into unique frameworks. But each economic model is like a partial map that illuminates a fragment of the terrain. Taken together, economists’ models are our best cognitive guide to the endless hills and valleys that constitute social experience.</p>
<p>Training in economics consists essentially of learning a sequence of models. Perhaps the most important determinant of the pecking order in the profession is the ability to develop new models, or use existing models in conjunction with new evidence, to shed light on some aspect of social reality.</p>
<p>For critics, economists’ reliance on models captures almost everything that is wrong with the profession: the reduction of the complexities of social life to a few simplistic relationships, the willingness to make patently untrue assumptions, the obsession with mathematical rigor over realism, the frequent jump from stylized abstraction to policy conclusions.</p>
<p>The Cambridge University economist Ha-Joon Chang says, “95 percent of economics is common sense—made to look difficult, with the use of jargons and mathematics.”</p>
<p>In truth, simple models of the type that economists construct are absolutely essential to understanding the workings of society. Their simplicity, formalism, and neglect of many facets of the real world are precisely what make them valuable. These are a feature, not a bug.<br>What makes a model useful is that it captures an aspect of reality. What makes it indispensable, when used well, is that it captures the most relevant aspect of reality in a given context.</p>
<p>When models are selected judiciously, they are a source of illumination. When used dogmatically, they lead to hubris and errors in policy.</p>
<p>A model focuses on particular causes and seeks to show how they work their effects through the system. A modeler builds an artificial world that reveals certain types of connections among the parts of the whole—connections that might be hard to discern if you were looking at the real world in its welter of complexity.</p>
<p>Models do more than warn us that results could go either way. They are useful because they tell us precisely what the likely outcomes depend on.</p>
<p>This is the distinction that philosophers of science refer to as internal versus external validity.<br>A well-designed experiment that successfully traces out cause and effect in a specific setting is said to have a high degree of “internal validity.” But its “external validity” depends on whether its conclusion can travel successfully outside the experimental context to other settings.</p>
<p> Sound extrapolation in turn requires a combination of good judgment, evidence from other sources, and structured reasoning. The power of all these types of experiments is that they teach us something about the world outside the context in which they’re carried out, on account of our ability to discern similarity and draw parallels across diverse settings.</p>
<p>Simplification and abstraction necessarily require that many elements remain counterfactual in the sense that they violate reality. What is the best way to think about this lack of realism?</p>
<p>Economic models consist of clearly stated assumptions and behavioral mechanisms. As such, they lend themselves to the language of mathematics.</p>
<p>Math essentially plays two roles in economics, neither of which is cause for glory: clarity and consistency.<br>First, math ensures that the elements of a model—the assumptions, behavioral mechanisms, and main results—are stated clearly and are transparent. Once a model is stated in mathematical form, what it says or does is obvious to all who can read it.<br>The second virtue of mathematics is that it ensures the internal consistency of a model—simply put, that the conclusions follow from the assumptions. This is a mundane but indispensable contribution.</p>
<p>Verbal arguments that seem intuitive often collapse, or are revealed to be incomplete, under closer mathematical scrutiny. The reason is that “verbal models” can ignore nonobvious but potentially significant interactions.</p>
<p>Some branches of economics, such as mathematical economics, have come to look more like applied mathematics than like any kind of social science. Their reference point has become other mathematical models instead of the real world.</p>
<p>The good news is that, contrary to common perception, math for its own sake does not get you far in the economics profession. What’s valued is “smarts”: the ability to shed new light on an old topic, make an intractable problem soluble, or devise an ingenious new empirical approach to a substantive question. In fact, the emphasis on mathematical methods in economics is long past its peak.<br>Today, models that are empirically oriented or policy relevant are greatly preferred in top journals over purely theoretical, mathematical exercises. The profession’s stars and most heavily cited economists are those who have shed light on important public problems, such as poverty, public finance, economic growth, and financial crises—not its mathematical wizards</p>
<p>Despite the math, economic models tend to be simple. For the most part, they can be solved using pen and paper.</p>
<p>“Big data gives us a chance to view society in all its complexity,” writes one of the leading proponents of this view. This would send our traditional economic models the way of the horse and buggy.</p>
<p>As Watts notes, disturbances in one part of the economy—say, in mortgage finance —can be amplified and produce major shocks for the entire economy, as in the “butterfly effect” from chaos theory.</p>
<p>In some settings, a simple model can be, well, too simple. We may need more detail. The trick is to isolate just the interactions that are hypothesized to matter, but no more.</p>
<p>Economic models are relevant and teach us about the world because they are simple. Relevance does not require complexity, and complexity may impede relevance. Simple models —in the plural—are indispensable. Models are never true; but there is truth in models. We can understand the world only by simplifying it.</p>

            <p>社会科学对于因果关系的关注使得倾向值匹配( propensity score matching) 的方法受到越来越多的重视。</p>
<p>本文从以下几个方面对这一方法进 行述评。<br>首先，本文系统梳理了倾向值匹配方法的历史、发展及其对于社会 学调查研究的意义。<br>其次，通过一个具体实例，本文展示了倾向值匹配的具 体实施过程。<br>第三，从密尔对因果关系的论述以及统计学的反事实框架 ( counterfactual framework) 出发，本文阐释了倾向值匹配如何通过“控制”混 淆变量从而满足非混淆假设( unconfoundedness) 来帮助研究者提出因果性结 论。<br>第四，本文将倾向值匹配与回归中断设计和工具变量进行了比较。<br>最 后，在简要分析倾向值匹配的局限性之后，本文讨论了倾向值匹配的最新发 展趋势。</p>
<p>倾向值指被研究的个体在控制 可观测到的混淆变量( confounding variables) 的情况下受到某种自变量 影响的条件概率。在一般的实证研究中，由于存在很多其他变量混淆 自变量和因变量之间的关系，研究者很难直接探索二者之间的“净效 果”( net effects) 。。这些 混淆变量的影响通常被称为选择性误差( selection bias) ，而通过倾向值 匹配的方式来控制和消除选择性误差则是罗森鲍姆和鲁宾论文的题中 之义。罗森鲍姆和鲁宾用数理方法证明: 通过将这些混淆变量纳入 Logistic 回归模型来产生一个预测个体受到自变量影响的概率( 倾向 值) ，研究者可以通过控制倾向值来遏制选择性误差对研究结论的影 响从而保证因果结论的可靠性。</p>
<p>在各种控制倾向值的方法中，匹配( matching) 比较简便易行。其 基本逻辑是将受到自变量影响的个体与没有受到影响的个体进行配 对。</p>
<p>在得到倾向值之后，罗森鲍姆和鲁宾提出了多种 控制 倾 向 值 的 方 法: 除 了 匹 配 之 外，也可以将倾向值分层 ( stratification) 或细分( sub-classification) ，然后在每个层次或类别内探 索因果关系; 或者也可以将倾向值作为新的变量进行回归分析。① 而 在赫克曼的计量经济学传统中，倾向值主要是作为一个新的变量被纳 入到已有的计量经济模型中，例如选择模型( selection model) ，工具变 量( instrumental variable) ，或 双 重 差 分 方 法 ( difference-in-differences method) 。需要指出的是，这种差异只是在处理倾向值的具体方式上的 不同，本质上这两个传统的基本逻辑是一致的，即在考察自变量效果之 前通过模型估计并控制个体受到自变量影响的概率。</p>
<p>基于调查资料的 研究 也 被 称 为“观 察 性 研 究”( observational studies) ( Rosenbaum， 2002) 。在实验性研究中，选择性误差可以通过随机化( randomization) 的方法来克服，但在观察性研究中，类似的随机化是不可能的。</p>
<p>对于这种选择性误差，我们 可以通过赫克曼误差修正模型( selection correction model) 来进行控制， 但这个模型实施起来较为复杂。相比而言，倾向值匹配为我们提供了 一种更为直观简便的处理选择性误差的方法。</p>
<p>倾向值匹配通常配合敏感性分析( sensitivity analysis) 来检验我们在 预测倾向值时是否忽略了某些关键的混淆变量。</p>
<p>当我们谈及因果性的时候，我们往往会回归到 密尔对求同法( method of agreement) 及求异法 ( method of differences) 的讨论。</p>
<p>从“控制”的角度出发，倾向值匹配十分巧妙地完成了对多个混淆 变量的控制。</p>
<p>倾向值匹配的办法 巧妙地解决了这个多混淆变量下的“多维”( multiple dimensional) 问 题: 它不再关注每个需要控制的混淆变量的具体取值，而是转而关注将 这些变量纳入 Logistic 回归方程后预测出来的倾向值取值。只要保证 倾向值匹配，这些所有需要控制的混淆变量就都考虑到了( Rosenbaum ＆ Rubin，1983) 。这样做实际上是将对多个混淆变量的控制转为对倾 向值的控制从而达到“降维”( dimension reduction) 的目的。换句话说， 无论有多少需要控制的混淆变量，我们都能够通过倾向值匹配的方法 将它们控制，从而帮助我们得出因果性结论。因此，从“控制”的角度 出发，倾向值匹配法很好地解决了多混淆变量时的控制问题，从而支持 了因果推论。</p>
<p>反事实框架( counterfactual framework)</p>
<p>这在 统计学上称为“非混淆假设”( unconfoundedness assumption)</p>
<p>“回归中断设计”( regression discontinuity design)，回归中断设计 中只有一个混淆变量 x。</p>
<p>工具变量( instrumental variable)，利用工具变量进行因果推论需要满 足很多假设条件( Imbens ＆ Angrist，1994) 。<br>第一个假设称为“单位实验效果值稳定假设”( stable unit treatment value assumption) 。<br> 第二个假设就是上面提到的非混淆假设，即抽签的结 果和个体的健康之间相互独立。由于这里是随机抽签，因此这一条件 得到满足。<br>第三个假设是“排除性假设”( exclusion restriction) 。这一 假设意味着在因果推论中排除两类人。第一类人是无论抽签结果如何 都会服兵役( 总是服兵役的人) ，而第二类人是无论抽签结果如何都不 会服兵役( 总是不服兵役的人) 。<br>第四个假设是“平均因果效果非 零”( nonzero average causal effect) ，即保证如果抽中的号码小，则服兵 役的概率就高。<br>最后一个假设是“单调性”( monotonicity) ，意味着抽 中小数字的人去服兵役的概率要比抽中大数字的人去服兵役的概率 高。 根据这一假设，那些“低数字偏偏不服兵役”而“高数字偏偏服兵 役”的“叛逆者”就被排除在外了。</p>
<p>任何统计方法都有其自身的局限性，倾向值匹配也不例外。<br>首先， 在社会学研究中，非混淆假定往往难以满足。正因为如此，很多研究会明确说明其结论有效性的前提是非混淆假设成立，如果假设不成立，结论也会相应受到 质疑( Brand ＆ Xie，2010) 。<br>其次，倾向值匹配假定个体之间不存在相互影响，即“单位实验效 果值稳定假设”。该假设也同样会在社会学研究中受到质疑。 在利用倾向值匹配去研究组织结构时，研究者需要十分注意这一假设。<br>第三，除上述基本假设之外，倾向值匹配并不考虑变量之间的交互 作用而只是关注某个我们关心的自变量的效果，同时和多元回归一样， 倾向值匹配也会受到忽略变量( omitted variables) 问题的影响。<br>此外， 目前主流统计软件分析的自变量是二分变量( 例如上不上大学) ，而对 连续型自变量的探讨还很不成熟。 总体而言，倾向值匹配方法主要应用于效果评估研究中 ( evaluation) 。例如上述大学教育对收入的影响以及摩根研究的天主教学校 对学生成绩的影响等等。<br>这类问题的一个共同点在于我们在分析数据 之前已经预先知道一个二分型的变量对于另外一个变量有因果效应。 此外，对那些影响二分变量的混淆变量，我们也应该具有比较清楚的理 论支持。在这种情况下，倾向值匹配会比较适用。然而，如果我们对谁 “影响”谁不是十分清晰( 例如互为因果) ，或者对于我们需要考虑哪些 混淆变量也不了解的话，倾向值匹配就很有可能违反上面提及的前提 假设，从而使我们的结论受到质疑。</p>
<p>完全匹配方法( full matching) 可以提高样本的利用率从而保证每个个体都能在匹配过程中被 使用到 ( Hansen，2004; Stuart ＆ Green，2008 ) 。<br>遗 传 性 匹 配 ( genetic matching) 则利用人工智能的方法提高匹配效率，其过程甚至不需要计算具体的倾向值( Sekhon ＆ Mebane，1998) 。<br>其 次，倾向值匹配方法的另一个发展趋势在于对更多研究情景的考虑。 例如，新的技术开始被开发出来以考察如何将倾向值匹配应用于自变 量是连续型的情况( Hirano ＆ Imbens，2004) ，或自变量超过两个取值水 平的情况( Lechner ＆ Miquel，2005) 。<br>最后，倾向值匹配和现有统计模 型和统计技术也越来越多地结合起来。这方面已有的探索包括将倾向 值匹配和分层模型结合起来考察因果效果在不同群体中体现出的异质 性( Brand，2010; Brand ＆ Davis，2011; Brand ＆ Xie，2010) ，以及利用贝 叶斯方法考察倾向值计算的不确定性( An，2010) 。<br>这三个发展趋势预 示着倾向值匹配方法会在未来一段时间有更大的飞跃。</p>

            <p>Lesson 1 On the Cost of Holding Money<br>Thinking in the vein, one can look at a number of financial assets, ranging from Treasury bills to long-term bonds. If each of these has a nominal yield of rj, and if the inflation rate is π, then the real yield of the asset is rj-π.<br>On currency, which to my knowledge never bears a nominal yield, the real yield is always -π (the negative of the rate of inflation). This is, everywhere and always, the actual real yield of holding cash balances in the form of currency.<br>Simply changing signs, we can speak of the cost of holding currency as π, that of holding demand deposits as (π-rj). From here one can see a change in the rate of inflation generates an own-price effect on all components of money, while rises in different interest rates generally give rise to cross-price effect.</p>
<p>Lesson 2 For any component of Money Pays Interest, a Rise in its Interest Rate Increases the Demand for Real Balances of that Component<br>When I first started observing the Latin American scene in the mid-1950s, the main inflationary countries were in the Southern Cone of South America. The inflationary disease at that time took a particular and characteristic form. The countries had not yet come to accept inflation as their fate, nor had they learned to cut if off at its root (fiscal deficits financed by rapid monetary expansion). But they were always trying to bring inflation under control. Hence they held on to a number of policies that were at best weak reeds, and at worst downright counterproductive for their economies. Among these policies were:<br>(a) exchange rates that were held fixed, long beyond the point when economic evidence would have dictated a change;<br>(b) prohibit of interest payments on demand deposits;<br>(c) limitation of the interest rates on time and savings deposits (sometimes via regulations, sometimes via usury laws) to maximum levels that ended up being well below the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>When the inflationary fires began to burn, in such a setting, the cost of holding all types of money rose – currency, demand deposits, time and savings deposits were all rendered less attractive to hold, and, indeed, holdings of all of them declined in real terms, or at least as a fraction of GDP. But the notable fact was that time and savings deposits tended to decline much more than currency and demand deposits. U.S. dollars proved a far better store of value than did savings deposits during the inflationary episodes of the 1950s and 1960s, and so, too, of course, did virtually any durable physical asset. These types of assets proved to be much more ready substitutes for time and savings deposits than for currency and demand deposits. Hence the ratio of time and savings deposits to M2 fell sharply as a consequence of inflation.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to some of the same countries in the period starting with the mid-1970s. By this time financial markets had been very substantially freed. Interest rates on demand deposits tended to be limited, but those on time deposits were substantially freed. The result was that time deposits remained attractive assets to hold, and in certain cases became almost the single most attractive asset to hold. In Chile, for example, during the period 1976, the real rate of interest received by depositors on renewable 30-day time deposits averaged over 2-percent per month.</p>
<p>During this more recend period, the reaction of time and savings deposits to the phenomenon of inflation was quite the reverse of what it was in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead of the ratio of these to M2 going way down as a consequence of inflation, it went sharply up, or at worst held its own.</p>
<p>Lesson 3 On Moentary Expansions Driven by the Demand for Credit<br>In the old days, when both rates of interest, rd and rs were held significantly below the rate of inflation, (M1/Y) was low because of the mere fact of inflation, and (M2-M1)/Y was lower still, compared to what it would be in a normal, stable, non-inflationary equilibrium for the reasons set out in Lesson 2 above. The consequent low level of (M2-M1/Y) set a limit on the amount of real credit that the banking system could offer – the system’s total assets being pretty much dictated by the size of its total monetary liabilities. In short, as the public ran away from holding real monetary balances because of inflation (or inflation expextations), the supply of real credit was squeezed.</p>
<p>In the more recent situations, with modernized and competitive banking system, (M1/Y) was squeezed in much the same way as before, but (M2-M1)/Y could be substantially the same as in a non-inflationary equilibrium, or even higher, as holders of time and savings deposits were rewarded with real yields that were almost always positive and much of the time far above the real yields that people were accustomed to, even in non-inflationary environments.</p>
<p>Needless to say, when the markets for bank credit were modernized, the situation changed dramatically. Interest rates paid by borrowers came to be closely linked to those received by depositors (at least for time deposits). Credit rationing of the old type simply disappeared. As a result, the allocation of investible funds through the banking system came to be much more efficient. The interest rate came once again to play its natural role as a signal for the allocation of credit in the first instance, and beyond that, of investible resources.</p>
<p>The simplest way to describe the events leading up to the widespread failures of banks is that competition among banks got underway, but with a vengeance. The natural incentives and instincts of bankers led to a fierce competition for deposits, in which the deposits went mostly to those paying the highest interest rates. But those who paid the highest interest rates could do so only by receiving very high rates on their loans, which in turn only happened with the riskiest categories of loans. We now believe that with a greatly improved system of bank regulation, including much better articulated rules for government bailouts of failing banks, the great banking collapses of the 1980s might have been avoided.</p>
<p>Lesson 4 On Stocks and Flows: The Loanable Funds and the Liquidity Preference Approaches<br>(M/P) = L(Y, r)<br>S(Y, r) = I(r)<br>To try to put it in a different perspective, think of equation (1) not as a demand function for real cash balances but as a sort of semi-reduced-form equation describing the operation of the financial system. Looked at in this way it reads as follows:<br>If, for a given level of real income, there are large real cash balances, then the banking system will likely be willing to supply a large amount of loans, which in turn will conduce toward low interest rates. Conversely, low real money balances lead to small amounts of bank loans, hence to high interest rates. Here we have what is the quintessential liquidity preference function affecting the interest rate, but only via the supply of loanable funds from the financial system.</p>
<p>My own preference is to think of the long-term interest rate being determined in the market for long-term bonds and the short-term interest rate being determined in the market for the short-term paper. In each of these markets one can look at either stocks or flows, or both. But in reality, I think the aspect of stocks is more central, more critical in the market for, say, 30-year bonds, while the aspect of flows is more important in the market for, say, 90-days paper.</p>
<p>In an economy in which most real magnitudes are growing at around 3 percent per year, the annual ‘flow supply’ of 30-year bonds will be only about 6 percent of last year’s stock, while the annual flow supply of 90-days notes will be over 400 percent of last year’s stock.</p>
<p>The biggest task of the interest rate on 30-year bonds is to convince people to keep on holding the 97 percent of last year’s stock which does not come due this year, once this task has been performed, relatively minor variations in the rate will likely take care of the new flow supply that is coming on the market this year. In contrast, the entire stock of credit turns over four times a year in the market for 90-day paper. So here, flow considerations have a much greater relative impartance.</p>
<p>Once one realizes that it is quite possible for real interest rates to be significantly above the world market rate, there arises the question of how to ‘model’ this phenomenon – how to make it fit into a simplified but self-contained picture of a country’s macroeconomy. After much thought on this subject, motivated not only by the present chain of reasoning but by others, arising from different starting points, I have come to the conclusion that the most sensible way to model this phenomenon is via a ‘supply curve of foreign funds’ facing the economy in question, which has a significant upward slope.</p>
<p>Lesson 5 On Capital-Flow Linkages to the Rest of the World<br>The Mexican and Chilean cases are only two out of many in which there is a substantial gap between local interest rates and those of the major world financial centers. It is fashionable today to say that any such difference among interest rates is to be attributed to an expectation of devaluation of the currency with the higher rate.</p>
<p>Thus, I see Luxembourg as facing a flat, infinitely elastic supply curve of funds (over the relevant range of variation). But this obviously was not true of Chile or Mexico in the instances cited, and is not true of a great many developing countries where we observe significant differentials between their interest rates and those of the world market. Here, I believe the simpliest approach is to postulate an upward-rising supply curve of funds, without attributing the rate differential exclusively to an expectation of devaluation.</p>
<p>Lesson 6 On ‘Expected’ Magnitudes: Interest Rates, Inflation Rates, Devaluation Rates, etc.<br>I believe that we have gotten enormous mileage out of the capital asset pricing model, and out of similar insights applied to other areas, including expected rates of inflation and expected rates of devaluation in some circumstances.<br>But there are important cases where the collaspsing of expectations into a single representative view can fall far wide of the mark. In these cases we must recognize that supply and demand are more fundamental economic concepts, in the sense that we can (and do) have many markets in which the concept of a representative agent makes no sense.</p>
<p>In any case like the above, of things used for multiple purpose to fulfill quite different desires, it is quite clear that the relevant curves are unlikely to be flat.</p>
<p>We can postulate a rising supply curve of funds without asking that its slope be only due to expectations of devaluation, and without imaging that ‘typical’ market participants all share the same view on such a matter. If we simply stick with the idea of a rising supply curve, we can build a view in which incremental demand for funds in a developing country raises interest rates there, widening the spread between its interest rates and those of the world market. Within this framework, the incremental demand will be met partly by displacing investments, partly by stimulating domestic saving, and partly by attracting incremental funds from abroad. This vision of the process fits the evidence we have from most developing countries much better than does the notion of infinitely elastic supply curves of funds.</p>
<p>Lesson 7 On Shifting Appraisals of Developing Country Capital Markets.<br>One thing we can be quite sure of is that any scheme that tries to rationalize actual events in developing country capital markets must recognize that world market perceptions change through time – sometimes very dramatically.</p>
<p>That is why cross-sectional analysis using observations from different countries has been so difficult.</p>
<p>Taking the supply curves of funds to be upward sloping, as I have argued they are, we can somewhat enrich the simple picture of ‘shifting curves.’ For not only do these curves shift with changing circumstances, but there are systematic changes in their elasticities. If Luxembourg faces a curve of virtually infinite elasticity and no premium, and perhaps Angola or Burma a curve very low elasticity and a high premium, then the situations of other countries can take virtually any position in the spectrum thus defined. </p>
<p>Lesson 8 The Position and Elasticity of the Supply Curves of Funds Facing a Country are Critical for Understanding and Diagnosing its Economy<br>The first pillar of Buchi’s strategy was a dollar that was expensive in real terms. This would give a strong incentive to develop export activities and also would foster a healthy type of import substition. But while it is quite feasible (if not always easy) for a country to fix its nominal exchange rate with the dollar or some other foreign currency, the same cannot be side for the real exchange rate. Adjustments in real exchange rates may take place under a flexible system via movements of the nominal exchange rate. Under a fixed rate system, the same adjustments occur through internal inflation and deflation. A fixed nominal price of the dollar, initially set high, does not guarantee a high real rate for any significant length of time. This high dollar price would soon generate trade surpluses; these would be cashed at the Central Bank, causing monetary expansion. This would go on, in principle until the trade surplus was eliminated, which would happen when the real exchange rate was again in equilibrium. But this real exchange rate would entail a real price of the dollar quite a bit lower than the starting point, in which the price of the dollar was raised from an initial equilibrium level, with a view to stimulating exports. </p>
<p>What the Buchi team did, taking advantage of the foreign exchange control system that had been in existence all along, was to auction off to the private speculators the right to engage in this sort of debt repatriation. Since the demand of the speculators to do this was quite large, the government in effect extended the length of time over which the process was distributed. But that was not the purpose. The purpose was that of producing equilibrium in the market for foreign exchange at the real exchange rate that the government was targeting.</p>
<p>The force driving this major change in capital market equilibrium was Chile’s ever-closer linkage to the world capital market, with the quantities of foreign capital in Chile becoming ever bigger, and the premium over world interest rates becoming ever smaller. This brought with it the danger that as the government sucked funds out of the domestic market (in order to buy foreign exchange to keep the real exchange rate on target), foreign funds would quickly flow in to replace what the government got. In a perfectly linked capital market, this would lead to a situation where:<br>(a) interest rates do not change, and<br>(b) neither does the real exchange rate move from outside to within the target zone.<br>In effect, the government would be rendered virtually impotent, using the actions previously described, to influence either the interest rate or the real exchange rate. </p>
<p>Lesson 9 On the determination of the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate<br>Movements in the real exchange rate (RER) typically entail changing relative prices as between tradable and nontradable goods.</p>
<p>If the country has a fixed exchange rate system, the equilibrating mechanism is like that under a gold standard. A surplus in the balance of trade leads to an expansion in the money supply and a consequent rise of the prices of nontradables relative to tradables; a deficit works the other way. Thus, the equilibrating process under fixed exchange rates works through the country’s general price level rather than through its nominal exchange rate. But, either way, the real exchange rate, as defined above, can seek and reach its equilibrium level.</p>
<p>Mexicans may have billions of dollars of assets in the U.S.; that fact by itself has no impact on Mexicans’ real exchange rate, but if they are in the process of building up those assets, that fact operates to raise the real price of the dollar above what it would otherwise be, and if they are in the process of reducing their asset position abroad and repatriating their capital, that fact operates to lower the RER.</p>
<p>Lesson 10 On the Relationship between Real-Exchange-Rate Analysis and the Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments<br>For myself, I have never been uncomfortable with the terms like (Ms-Md), having learned from the most brilliant of Alfred Marshall’s insights that an observed point can simultaneously be one of equilibrium (in a short-term sense) and of disequilibrium (in a longer-term sense). To me, the existense of excess cash balances does not mean that it then becomes a puzzle why people are holding them. It means instead that so long as the other relevant determining variables remain the same; people will choose to engage in an adjustment process by which they bring these balances down to the longer-run demand level Md.</p>
<p>Lesson 11 On the Tantalizing Analogy between International Capital Flow and the Expansion of Domestic Bank Credit<br>(a) a capital flow from abroad spent fully on tradables, and<br>(b) a credit expansion at home to the same borrowers, also spent fully on tradables<br>Once again we have a corresponding loss of reserves, and when all the accounts are in, we have an increase in foreign liabilities in case (a), and a loss of foreign assets in case (b).</p>
<p>I do not claim here to have solved the puzzle of how far to extend the analogy between foreign borrowing on the one hand and domestic credit expansion on the other. I do hope, however, to have stimulated readers to puzzle and speculate further on this fascinating set of issues.</p>

            <p>Democracy is the sort of force that has been constantly expanded by the development of history; it is something that in itself requires creativity, renewal, and advancement in broader contexts and in more concrete ways. Because of this, when I say we need a democratic practice to cope with the problems that now face us, the democracy I am referring to – even though it includes the sum, the reflection on, and the development of all historical instances of democracy – by no means refers to a ready made pattern that can be readily copied. Rather, it should be a creative process, a broad social reality that takes into account specific political, economic, and cultural practices. It is precisely for this reason that I have attempted to see the predicament facing China and the crises afflicting the rest of the contemporary world – including the so called democratic Western world – as different facets of an interrelated historical process.</p>
<p>Like much contemporary Western analysis of this transformation, Wang’s account focuses on what are most often taken in the West as the contradictions of the process, notably rapid economic deregulation conjoined with a still highly intrusive state.</p>
<p>(Theodore Huters)<br>The creation of today’s market society was not the result of a sequence of spontaneous events, but rather of state interference and violence. In other words, were there no governments to set the terms and guarantee the structure of the markets that the advocates of this system – the neoliberals – claim to be regulated only by a Smithian invisible hand, these institutions would not have come into existence in the first place, could neither sustain themselves nor function as they do. This has marked a fundamental change in the world: ‘the core of the neoliral conception of globalization…no longer recognizes the division between politics and economic characteristic of the nineteenth century, but rather envisions the workings of the economy, markets, and capital as replacing the political and social spheres.’</p>
<p>Those in charge of implementing the last will and testament of the revolution [that is, the Party leadership] carry out their dual responsibilities in an absurd fashion: on the one hand they clownishly bury all of the reasonable aspects of the revolution and of socialism, while on the other they employ state violence and monopolization to guarantee the smooth transition of a Chinese economy in crisis to one based on market mechanisms, in the process wrecking all of the equitable features of the social guarantees contained within the old system.</p>
<p>The most one can say about the conflict between the Chinese version of neoliberalism and the ultraconservative state ideological apparatus is that it reflects an internal contradiction in the functioning of the state. While neoliberalism takes every opportunity to cast itself in the image of ‘resister’, this does not prove that this ideology of the market is in actual opposition to the practical operations of the state: on the contrary, the state and neoliberalism exist in a complex relationship of codependence.</p>
<p>There are many profound cautionary tales to be learned from Chinese socialism, but these lessons have nothing to do with the realization of egalitarianism. Quite on the contrary, they stemmed from the failure of its egalitarian objectives ever to be really implemented. In other words, what deserves criticism is not the victories won by the socialist movement in the realm of equality, but the new hierarchy and notions of social status that were created in the process.</p>
<p>It is clear that in different parts of the contemporary world, such as North America, Western Europe, Russia, and China, neoliberalism has its own historical roots and social patterns. These differences in historical circumstance have determined that there is no way to adduce convincing conclusions by merely summing up the character of neoliberalism at an abstract level.</p>
<p>The simultaneous existence of planned pricing and market pricing provided perfect conditions for corruption and official peculation.</p>
<p>The social contradiations of 1989 should not be understood as the state promoting reform and various elements of society opposing it, but rather as people demanding even greater reform, given the decline of the old system. The crux of the problem lay in specifying the shape that reform would take. Regardless of whether we are talking about students, intellectuals, or any others who participated in the movement in support of reform (political or economic) and demands for democracy, their hopes for and understanding of reform were extraordinarily diverse. When looked at from a broader or synthetic perspective, however, the reforms the greater part of the populace hoped for and their ideals of democracy and rule by law were for the purpose of guaranteeing social justice and the democratization of economic life through the restructuring of politics and the legal system. They did not wish for a set of political procdures and legal stipulations that were intended merely to demonstrate the legitimacy of carving up social assets as they existed at the time.</p>
<p>Any critical perspective on the problems of contemporary China should not cover up the amazing achievements brought about through this process of reform. In undertaking a historical analysis, however, we cannot ignore the profound and complicated consequences and historical imprints left by the state ideology.</p>
<p>Local and Beijing based interest groups welcomed the new initiative because new reforms signaled further devolution, which meant resolution of the contradictions that had arisen in the period of adjustment between central control and local interests.<br>The intellectuals welcomed the new initiative because they believed that as long as reforms were implemented and a market economy was created, then progress toward democracy in China would eventually take place.<br>Foreign public opinion welcomed this initiative because it meant that China was once again moving toward the fixed objective of ‘the end of history’.</p>
<p>The discourse of ‘the end of history’ that followed upon 1989, however, provided a clear-cut explanation of the events of that year: namely, that it represented the final victory of the Western social system, with China as werely an isolated and incomplete historical instance.</p>
<p>Should neoliberalism’s market program suddenly result in an economic crisis, it could lead to calls for protectionism and isolationism. The historical experiences of Asia and Europe all show that the strengthening of economic relations does not necessarily lead to peace, unity, and integration, and the crises created by market ideology can frequently lead to conflict and isolation; all sorts of ‘scared alliances’ have been formed with resistance, throttling of competition, protectionism, and war as their motives. Thus, critism of neoliberalism is not a rejection of free exchange and free trade, but rather rejection of the closures, protectionism, isolation, and tendencies toward conflict concealed in its developmental logic.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the discussion of practical matters cannot avoid returning to more theoretical and comprehensive reflections, since the crux of today’s problems cannot be seperated into isolated components. The discussion must root itself deeply in the internal logic of modern society, because if it fails to think things through at this level, a social movement of resistance and the critical thinking that goes along with it run the risk of slipping into the logic of that which they are resisting in the first place.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Chinese government’s persevering support for socilism does not pose an obstacle to the following conclusion: in all of its behaviors, including economic, politicl, and cultural – even in governmental behavior – China has completely conformed to the dictates of capital and the activities of the market. If we aspire to understand Chinese intelletual and cultural life in the last decade of the twentieth century, we must understand the above transformations and their corresponding social manifestations.</p>
<p>The end of the Cultural Revolution marked the end of a socialism characterized by perpetual revolution and the critique of capitalism. In 1978, the socialist reform movement that has lasted to this day began. On the level of ideology, the criticism of prior socialism forcused first on its idealistic system of public ownership and egalitarianism, both of which led to a decrease in efficiency, and second on the dictatorial methods that caused political damage to the whole country. At the same time as the evaluation and the historical summing-up were proceeding, China’s socialist reforms, with improved efficiency as their focus, were launched.</p>
<p>In addition, in the course of reform and opening up, China was gradually absorbed into the global capitalist  market. </p>
<p>These reforms have plainly advanced economic development and reshaped the preexisting social structure, but what they have abandoned is Mao’s idealistic modernization methods while continuing the goal of modernization. Different from prereform modernization, the most important chracteristics of the socialist reforms that China is now implementing are marketization in the economic arena and the convergence of the Chinese economy, society, and the culture with the contemporary capitalist system.</p>
<p>The astonishing achievements brought about in China by the contemporary socialist reforms are not limited to the economic arena, but also entail profound political implications.</p>
<p>The reconsideration of China’s problems by placing them in the context of globalization is an urgent theoretical problem. </p>
<p>The modern era, as a historical phase, continues. This provides the impetus for the continued existence and development of critical thought; it may prove for Chinese intellectuals to be a historic opportunity for theoretical and institutional innovation.</p>

            <p>In the closing decades of the twentieth century, China defied the best predictions of development economists and Sinologists alike in compiling a stunning record of economic growth. This was accomplished in the face of formidable obstacles including inefficient state enterprises, ambiguous property rights, irrational prices, primitive transportation, and outmoded banking and securities facilities. </p>
<p>In sum, reforms generated both from above and from below have brought far-reaching, even cataclysmic, changes to the economy, society, politics and culture, changes that touch every citizen and extend to every corner of the land and beyond to redefine China’s place in the world.</p>
<p>It is commonly asserted that, despite far-reaching economic and social reform, China’s political system remains frozen.</p>
<p>Despite significant changes, an apparent disjuncture remains between the free-wheeling economic expansion, on the one hand, and the still highly circumscribed political climate, on the other.</p>
<p>The upsurge in such activities is attributable to several factors attendant upon the reforms: increased population mobility, high levels of surplus labour and unemploymen, growing income disparities, access to previously unavailable economic resources, and declining civic values.</p>
<p>The problem with the diverse theories sketched briefly above is that, while suggestive for analysing the psychological and material roots of protests, resistance, rebellion and revolution, none specifies the threshold point at which popular aspirations and grievances gain sufficient momentum to become politically threatening. Thus, however useful the theories may be in offering explanations for what occurred after the fact, and in drawing attention to areas of conflict and potential resistance, they offer little predictive value.</p>
<p>China’s extensive and deepening integration into the international system in general, and its various commitments to international laws and institutions in particular, have placed leaders under new constraints and provided dissidents with new sources of moral support.</p>
<p>Both liberty and equality are among the primary goals pursued by human beings throughout many centuries; but total liberty for wolves is death to the lambs, total liberty of the powerful, the gifted, is not compatible with the rights to a decent existence of the weak and the less gifted… Equality may demand the restraint of the liberty of those who wish to dominate; liberty - without some modicum of which there is not choice and therefore no possibility of remaining human as we understand the word - may have to be curtailed in order to make room for social welfare, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, to leave room for the liberty of others, to allow justice or fairness to be exercised.</p>
<p>Neo-liberal economists cautioned that an economy based on state ownership of the means of production could not sustain long-term, stable growth. In their view, privatization is a conditio sine qua non for the market economy This premise, enshrined in the ‘Washington Consensus’ became the guiding principle for many of the social engineering programmes of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the former Soviet Union and the East-bloc countries.</p>
<p>Women’s employment must be linked with women’s liberation. Economics is the foundation. Without participation in social production, women would have no economic status. This would in turn undermine the equality between men and women in politics, society and family.</p>

            <p>A study of 2866 farms in seventeen localities and seven provinces in China （1925-1930）</p>
<p>The basis of Chinese agriculture is a farm system of unfenced scattered plots of land for the most part inherited, difficult of management from the farmsteads which are usually located in villages or hamlets of varying size. These villages and hamlets dot the landscape about as thickly as do the solitary farmsteads in the United States, and this signifies a dense population as well as a rural social system entirely different from that in most western countries.</p>
<p>The farm land is generally worked by owners, although approximately one-fifth is farmed by tenants and another one-fifth by part owners, the extent of tenancy varying from almost none to nearly one hundred per cent tenants in some localities. Systems of rent are quite similar to those found in other countries. Rental charges, however, are often not fair either for the tenant or the landlord and on the average rents should be reduced something over one-fifth the present amount.</p>
<p>Not only is the area of land worked by the farmer in China small, but he has also far smaller capital and equipment than the western farmer. In fact, his main investment is labor, but even this is not very great since the Chinese farm averages only two men giving full time to the farm business compared with approximately one and one-half men in the United States. The relatively small amount of labor used on the limited amount of land is partly because the farm business is not sufficiently enlarged by the use of more intensive methods of farming.</p>
<p>The production from the farm business in China and in the United States is remarkably equal in quantity per unit of land, although the method of obtaining these products are entirely different. In the United States the chief means has been the use of capital as well as labor; in China it has been by the use of labor, for the most part human labor, and with very little capital. The resulting production per unit of labor in the United States is apparently at least twenty-five fold greater than in China. Because of the dense population and the high cost of capital, it is evident, therefore, that the great natural resources of China is her man power. What she has to do is to learn how to make the most of this immense resource, because, on the whole, neither human nor animal labor is used to its full capacity.</p>
<p>The remedies for this too small size of farm business are difficult to find. Colonization seems scarcely the solution, since lands for such extensive colonization as would be needed are limited, even in Manchuria and Northwest. Moreover, unless something is done to check the growth of population, colonization will do little permanent good. The same may be said of drawing men from the land to industry. As China becomes modernized, it is inevitable that industries will develop and a certain number of the country people be absorbed into them. Yet it can scarcely be hoped that sufficient numbers of them will be so absorbed as to relieve the present agricultural situation very much. The best future solution of the problem seems to be in some method of population control, and the best immediate solution, more intensive methods of raising crops and the growing of crops that produce more food per unit of land. Such productivity, however, will also be useless if population continues to grow.</p>
<p>The farmer’s life, moreover, needs to be enriched mentally as well as materially. Few of the farmers of China have enough education to enable them to profit from reading, and since three-fourths of the children of farmers are not in school, there seems little chance for immediate improvement in this respect. The farmer cannot be blamed for this directly, since the type of old-fashioned classical school, which has been the only one for him to attend, has not been one to give him any practical help or inspiration. His life seems meagre in recreation, although that he is a social creature is shown by the regular, though small, items expended yearly for tea-drinking with friends, religious cults, and like activities.</p>
<p>China has been a country without reliable statistics, and it is to her advantage to obtain them, not only from the point of view of taking her place in world statistics, but also for the important reason of self-knowledge before there can be self-improvement. This study was begun with the idea of collecting accurate data on Chinese farming conditions to teach to Chinese college students, so that these students might in the future discover for themselves the facts of their own country.</p>

            <p>Instead of making adjustments to the official aggregate data on investment, as other studies have done, we have used the commodity flow method. Estimates have been made for five investment components:<br>1) construction and installation,<br>2) domestic production of machinery and equipment,<br>3) imports of machinery and equipment,<br>4) office furniture and tools,<br>5) and other rural investment.<br>The five components have then been combined to form the estimates of total fixed investment. But in using this method we have been able to cover not only the investment made by the government within the state plan of basic construction but also the investment made by private concerns and households outside the state plan. The commodity flow method has also permitted us to adopt a new valuation basis.<br>The biases in the official valuation stemmed from two main sources: the underpayment of work brigades (draft labor) and the peculiar exchange rates used for computing the official values of imported goods. These biased have been removed in our estimates.</p>
<p>Our estimates generally confirm the government’s claim of investment acceleration in 1952-57. The average annual rate of fixed capital investment, that is, the proportion of GDP devoted to fixed capital formation, was 17.8 per cent in that period. This is remarkably higher than the estimated average rate of 7.5 per cent for 1931-36. If the comparison is made in terms of net capital formation, the difference between the two periods would be even wider. However, the years 1952-57 were followed by a period of tremendous fluctuations in fixed capital investment. Although there are no national income statistics, official or otherwise, which can be used to compute the exact rates of investment, we can say that the rates must have fallen to very low levels in 1961-64.</p>
<p>As in many underdeveloped countries, the speed of capital formation in prewar China was decisively constrained by the low level of voluntary saving in the private sector. In addition to the low level of income, the extremely low life expectancy gave rise to an age structure of the population unfavorable to saving efforts. An extraordinarily large proportion of people were under the working age. Both the birth rate and the infant mortality rate were high, so that a considerable amount of economic surplus in society had to be wasted on raising children who never grew old enough to participate in productive work.</p>
<p>So far as capital formation is concerned, the main change in the 1950’s occurred in the saving mechanism. Instead of relying on voluntary savings, the new government mobilized compulsory savings for the purpose of investment. The traditional constraint on saving was greatly relaxed thereby. In this way, the system of socialist planning can potentially serve as a shortcut to industrialization for underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p> The compulsory savings were realized in two major forms. First, through controls over wages and over prices of consumer goods, and the procurement programs and taxation in the rural areas, the government was able to restrain the consumption level and create budgetary surpluses. Those budgetary surpluses were tailored to, and would be used for, state investment. This is clearly shown by the chief role played by basic construction investment of the government in total capital formation throughout the Communist period.<br>The second form of compulsory saving was the direct use of surplus labor in rural areas for capital construction, such as road building and large water conservation projects. Although labor conscription is not unique in China, the scale which the Peking government used it during 1956-59 was certainly unprecedented. This scale would have been impossible had China not been socialized and the rural population not been regimented.</p>
<p>The steadily rising rate of investment in 1952-56 reflected the changed saving mechanism and the new investment drive of the Communist government; it was not the accidental burst of investment that is occasionally observed in a market economy. China really attempted to cut short the industrilization process by socializing the economy. However, compulsory savings in a socialist country are not without limitation. One of the serious problems is the contradiction between work incentives and a high rate of accumulation. As this study has shown, the economic policy of the Peking government entailed a high marginal propensity to invest. If over a long period most of the fruits of capital formation are devoted to further investment, sparing very little for improving living standards, the working masses might feel disappointed. This in fact was a major issue discussed by economists and planners in China in 1956-57. The consensus was that, while the pre-1956 rate of investment was correct, the rate in 1956 might be regarded as excessive. This review of investment policy led to the moderation in 1957.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the cautious opinions were silenced by Mao Tse-tung, who believes that revolutionary zeal can effectively overcome physical or material constraints. The second Five-Year Plan, carefully formulated by planners and formally approved by the National Congress, was torn up by Mao as sonn as it was made public. In its place came Mao’s Great Leap Forward movement. The fanatic investment and production drives nearly disintegrated the economy. The policy reversal adopted by the new leadership in the early 1960’s was meant to salvage the collapsing economy. One of the most urgent tasks was then to shift the emphasis from investment to consumption, so that work incentives could be restored.</p>
<p>What happened in China during the early 1960’s must be considered abnormal. It is only in very broad terms that one can connect the ups and downs in investment in the Communist era in a ‘functional’ way. That is, in such a political system there is no way to avoid extremist leaders. Consequently, extremist economic policies may occur from time to time, and policy reversals are required (i.e., functionally related) to redress the biases or heal the wounds.</p>
<p>Another crucial question is: What role did capital formation play in China’s economic growth during the Communist period? Interestingly, Western economists have traveled a full circle in their analyses of the function played by investment in an economy. The early Keynesian model, which focused on the problem of short-run stability in an economy, treated investment as a component of effective aggregate demand. This demand component was so volatile in a market economy that its fluctuation tended to cause depressions or inflations if it was not offset by a proper compensatory policy of the government. This view was later modified by E. D. Domar, who emphasized the double role of investment – as a demand component and as a capacity-creating factor on the supply side; from the new thesis came the famous Harrod-Domar model of economic growth. Thereafter, investment became virtually the most important element in all growth models developed by other economist. The importance of investment rested on its capacity-creating nature.</p>
<p>Another sharp turning point in the investment and growth theories came when R. M. Solow bulit his neoclassical model of economic growth. It is called neoclassical model because it assumes that full employment prevails all the time. Hence the function of investment as a demand component is completely ignored. The remaining question is then: How important is the other role played by investment – capacity-creating – in economic growth? According to Solow’s original calculation based on American historical data, the contribution of investment to economic growth was far less important than that of technological advancement. His results showed that 87 per cent of the increase in output per unit of labor input came from technological progresses and only 13 per cent stemmed from the expansion of capital stock.</p>
<p>One criticism of Solow’s initial model was that the measured contribution of technological changes is really a residual which reflects the working of all economic forces other than the inputs of labor and capital. Moreover, the importance of investment is understated because the model assumes that all technological changes have been the disemdodied type. Yet in reality the majority of innovations have to be embodied in new machines and equipment; the gains from those innovations cannot be realized unless firms make investments. This last point led Solow to develop his vintage model of economic growth, in which the embodiment effect of investment is taken into consideration. However, even in the vintage model and many other works which have subsequently appeared to refine Solow’s theory, the contribution of investment to economic growth is still overshadowed by other factors.</p>
<p>In a sense, in economic theory the importance of investment has shifted back from its connection with long-run economic growth to the connection with short-run economic stability. In other words, investment is important primarily because it is such a vital component in aggregate demand. In an affluent society, investment must take place at a high rate if effective demand is to be maintained at full employment. Otherwise a depression would set in.</p>
<p>In China investment has played a more important role than any that has been envisioned by the above models. Its importance, however, does not lie on the demand side. As a rule, there is no worry about demand deficiency in underdeveloped countries, since the propensity to save is low and there are adequate investment outlets. In fact, many of those countries are under constant pressure from inflation simply because domestic aggregate supply falls short of aggregate demand. In the case of Communist China, the situation is further simplified because the government has full control of saving, consumption, and investment.</p>
<p>The crucial role of investment is on the supply side. But even there the Solow model of economic growth does not apply fully. In view of the enormous gap in technology between China and industrially advanced countries, the proportion of technical changes that are of the embodied type must be greater in China than in the United States. Similarly, the quality difference of capital goods between two successive vintage points must be much wider in China than Solow’s model has postulated.</p>
<p>More important is the fact that Solow’s neoclassical assumption of full employment does not hold in China at all. China is perhaps the country with the largest surplus population, that is, persons whose marginal productivity falls below the minimum subsistence cost. In prewar China, capitalist firms hired workers up to the point at which their marginal productivity was equal to the subsistence wage. Thus, the bulk of surplus labor existed in the rural communities, where peasants, whether landowners or tenants, shared their incomes among family members. The situation has not drastically changed in the Communist era, since even state enterprises are unlikely to hire workers at a cost much higher than their contributions to production.</p>
<p>The marginal productivity of surplus labor is so low because the existing stock of capital goods is not sufficient to match the labor force. Only investment can provide extra employment opportunities in the urban areas and absorb unused labor productively in the rural areas. Therefore, in a backward country, both the technological changes and the absorption of surplus labor into production require new investment for embodiment. Where the amount of surplus labor is exceedingly large, as it is in China, the absorption of unused labor outweighs the embodiment of technological changes as the primary source of economic growth. In other words, output is increased at a higher speed by putting the unused labor in production rather than by raising the productivity of those who are already employed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the embodiment of technical changes and the absorption of unused labor. The new machines and production techniques developed by the advanced countries, including the Soviet Union, tend to be labor-saving, because their economies are characterized by labor shortages. Direct borrowing of modern technology from those countries without any adaptation would provide a minimum opportunity for new employment per unit of investment funds. This conflict is clearly demonstrated by the Chinese experience in their First Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>More than 80 per cent of the investment within the state plan in the First Five-Year Plan period went to heavy industry. It is estimated that investment in large plants accounted for over 60 percent of the planned total investment in industry. Ordinarily those large modern plants would require a relatively small amount of labor inputs per unit of fixed capital. In September 1956, when Chou En-lai announced the final version of the First Five-Year Plan, he anticipated that the industrial enterprises newly constructed or reconstructed during 1953-57 would contribute 15 per cent to the gross industrial value product for that period. By the end of 1957, however, it turned out that those new enterprises had actually contributed about 30 per cent to the gross value product. This increase was made possible through some adaptations to intensify the use of labor, such as the larger number of shifts of workers to assure a twenty-four-hour operation of machinery and equipment.</p>
<p>The investment policy adopted by the new leadership during 1961-65 was essentially a middle road, so far as the technological choice is concerned. It attempted to avoid the extreme in either direction. Although emphasis continued to be given to small-scale plants, those units were required to meet certain efficiency standards. Only under these circumstances could capital formation be expected to make its maximum contribution to economic growth.</p>
<p>We may conclude from our study that the Chinese experience has clearly demonstrated both the merits and demerits of the Communist approach to capital formation. On the credit side, a planned economy with all means of production controlled by the government can easily break some of the formidable barriers to economic growth that are generally encountered by underdeveloped countries. On the debit side, such an economy has no automatic mechanism which can effectively prevent economic policy in general and investement policy in particular from going to the extremes. The resulting series of adjustments and counter adjustments are a highly costly process.</p>

            <p>The transformation of the economy of the People’s Republic of China from a planned to a more market-oriented economy is one of the most significant developments in the world history during the last quarter of the 20th century.</p>
<p>A market economy differs from a centrally planned one in three important ways.<br>Major economic resources are privately owned rather than owned by the state.<br>Prices are determined by the market forces of demand and supply rather than by administrative orders.<br>Economic decisions concerning consumption, production, distribution, and investment are decentralized, being made by private citizens or individual enterprises rather than by central command.</p>
<p>A major objective of central procurement of agricultural products was to provide adequate supplies of essential food products to the urban residents under a system of rationing; among items rationed were food grain, vegetable oil, meat, sugar, and cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Since enterprises obtained their inputs through central allotment, surrended their outputs for central distribution, and had no control over their profits, they did not respond to prices. The main concern of enterprise managers was to obtain through skillful negotiations more than sufficient material and labor inputs to fulfill the production targets. They tended to understate the productive capacity of their enterprise in order to reduce output targets, and to overstate the input requirements in order to ensure their fulfillment. Inefficiencies and wastes occurred under this system, as partly reflected in the underutilization of prodcutive capacity and the large stockpiling of inventories in Chinese state enterprises (Zhou, 1982).</p>
<p>This ‘responsibility system’ is similar to private farming in a market economy, with each farm household leasing its land and paying the delivery quota as rent.</p>
<p>The major elements of the industrial reforms include<br>(i) a certain autonomy regarding the use of retained profits, production planning, sales of output, experimentation with new products, and capital expansion;<br>(ii) adoption of features of an ‘economic responsibility system’ by assignment of identifiable tasks to lower level units and payment to them according to productivity;<br>(iii) increase in the role of markets<br>(iv) the streamlining of the administrative system at local levels for enterprises under local control;<br>(v) the encouragement of the establishment of collectively owned enterprises.</p>
<p>Reform in the industrial sector has turned out to be more difficult than in the agricultural sector. It is much easier to make small farm householders behave like private enterprises in a market economy than to make large state enterprises so behave for four types of reasons.<br>First, ideologically, members of the Communist Party of China believe in the ownership and the control of the means of production by the state. They are unwilling to surrender control of large state enterprises to nongovernment individuals and allow them to keep substanial profits for themselves, as in the case of small farms.<br>Second, politically, government bureaucrats are unwilling to give up their power and vested interests by allowing the state enterprises to operate independently. Economic ministries tend to hold on to their control over the operations of the state enterprises. The bureau of material supplies tends to retain its control over the distribution of major material inputs.<br>Third, economically, large industrial enterprises are more dependent on factors outside their control than are the small household farms. Given a piece of land, a farm household can produce as it pleases, subject to climate conditions. A large industrial enterprise needs the supplies of equipment and of material inputs produced by other enterprises. The entire system of pricing and distribution of industrial products and material inputs has to be changed to provide more autonomy to the state enterprises.<br>Fourth, administratively, the efficient operation of a large industrial enterprise is much more difficult than operation of a small farm. Chinese managers often do not have sufficient knowledge and experience to run a modern enterprise as an independent entity. Even with additional training, managers and administrators of state enterprises are reluctant to give up their old habits of dependence on the economic ministries.<br>The mode of operation of a large economic organiation is difficult to change, as it is true for a large American corporation and more so for a large country like China.</p>
<p>Seven key elements of the Decision of 20 Oct 1984 concerning reform of the economic system are to<br>(i) give individual state enterprises autonomy in decisions regarding production, supply, marketing, pricing, investment, and personnel as independent profit-seeking economic units;<br>(ii) reduce the scope of central planning and, except for certain major products, change the method from mandatory planning to guidance planning;<br>(iii) allow prices of more products to be determined by the forces of demand and supply rather than by central control;<br>(iv) develop macroeconomic control mechanisms through the use of taxes, interest rates, and monetary policy under an improved financial and banking system;<br>(v) establish various forms of economic responsibility systems within individual enterprises to promote efficiency and encourage differential wage rates to compensate for different kinds of work and levels of productivity;<br>(vi) foster the development of individual and collective enterprises as supplements to the state enterprises;<br>(vii) expand foreign trade and investment as well as technological exchanges.<br>An often-quoted slogan to capture the essential characteristics of the reform is, ‘Invigorate the microeconomic units. Control by macroeconomic means.’</p>
<p>Reform toward a more market-oriented economy will continue in China. The degree of success may be uncertain, but there is no turning back to a system of central control in agriculture and in industry operating within closed doors. Substantial economic growth will continue even if structural reforms progress slowly. The Chinese economy was able to grow between 1952 to 1979 in spite of the adverse conditions of inefficient central planning and two very serious political disturbances. It can only be expected to grow faster under the more favorable economic and political conditions of the 1980s.</p>
<p>The first common feature in the growth process of both parts of China is the reduction of govenment intervention and the encouragement of private initiative.<br>Economic liberalization took place in Taiwan through government encouragement of private investment in the form of providing financial services of government banks, the establishment of a stock market, tax exemptions for certain industries, relaxing controls over the establishment of factories, and appropriately adjusting the prices of government-produced commodites and services.</p>
<p>The second common element is the important of the agricultural sector in the early stage of the growth process.<br>In both Taiwan and the Mainland, the  increase in agricultural productivity was achieved mainly by redistributing land to the farmers.</p>
<p>A third common feature is the promotion of exports as an important component of the development strategy.</p>
<p>The fourth element is the government’s emphasis on the stability of the general price level. The governments of both regions learned from the bitter experience of hyperinflation is China prior to the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, as inflation was recognized to be an important factor contributing to the collapse of the government of the Republic of China in the Mainland.<br>Two-digit inflation in the Mainland took place in 1988 because of the failure of the government to control the supply of money and credits, but price stability was restored by early 1990 mainly by contractionary monetary policy.</p>
<p>The fifth common element is the gradual decontrol of restrictions on imports and the setting of an official exchange rate close to the free market level.</p>
<p>Together with the rapid growth of the economy in the Mainland since 1977 was a transformation of the economy to a mostly private economy in the sense that by 1990 a large fraction of the national output was produced by profit-seeking individuals and enterprises whose incentives are similar to those prevailing in a market economy.</p>
<p>During that meeting, and a five-day meeting to follow in Beijing in June 1986 involving three other outside economists, John Fei of Yale, Anthony Koo of Michigan State and Lawrence Lau of Stanford, the author found the reform officials to be extremely open-minded. Any suggestions could be brought up for discussion. Important considerations are political feasibility and reaction of the population. Ideology becomes an issue only to the extent that Communist Party members and govenment officials with given ideological background needed to understand and be presuaded of the proposal if it is to be put into practice. Other than that I did not experience any more ideological constraints in our discussion and recommendations than in the discussion with economic officials in Taiwan in the 1960s to the 1980s when the same group of economists were advising them.</p>
<p>Concerning housing reform, it was recognized that housing should be ‘commercialized’ in the terminology of the Chinese government. By the ‘commercialization’ of housing, it meant making housing service a commodity subject to the law of demand and supply. One important consideration in housing reform is how to compensate the urban residents who, for several decades, have been accustomed to government subsidized housing. An obvious proposal is to increase urban wage to compensate for the increased cost of rent under a free market for housing. This creates the need to increase prices of products due to the increase in wage cost, which might argue that the effect would be a one-time increase in prices and not an inflationary process. The perception of the population concerning the inflationary process and the redistributional effects of increased rental with wage subsidies were important issues of discussion.</p>
<p>By Chinese official statistics, which follow the statistical system of the former Soviet Union, national output is divided into the five sectors of agriculture, industry, construction, transportation and commerce. In 1978 when reform began, there five sectors accounted respectively for 32.8, 49.4, 4.2, 3.9, and 9.8 percent of national income.<br>Of the total labor force of 401.5 million in 1978, 306.4 million or 76.3 percent were laborers in rural areas while 95.0 million were classified as staff and the remaining 20.5 million worked in collective enterprises in cities and towns.<br>In 1978, 77.6 percent of the gross output value of industry was from state enterprises.</p>
<p>Turning to the demand side, consumer demand in urban areas was controlled by the government in three essential aspects.<br>First, housing of staff and workers was assigned by the unit in which they worked, with negligible rent. There was no market for urban housing.<br>Second, important food items including grain, meat and oil were rationed at below market prices.<br>Third, the purchasing power of the urban consumer was controlled by controlling wage rates.</p>
<p>Two characteristics of the political environment deserve to be noted: The stability of political institutions and the large amount of popular support for economic reform.</p>
<p>Although Deng, Zhao and other leaders were confident of the general direction of reform towards a more market-oriented economy, in the sense of reducing central control and providing economic reward to individuals and economic units willing to produce more, they were not sure of exactly what economic institutions to establish. The procedure followed was one of experimentation. A favorite saying was ‘touching the rocks as you cross the river,’ deciding on the next step only after you have completed the previous step.</p>
<p>While it was easy to adopt the responsibility system in small state enterprises, the system was not easy, and in the early stage of reform not intended, for large enterprises.</p>
<p>Controlling the prices of certain government-distributed products while allowing them to be set in free markets led to a two-tier price system. The welfare effect of such a system was debated by economists. While admitting the virtue of free market prices, some critized the simultaneously existing controlled prices. When the government was the purchaser of certain products at below market prices, the seller essentially paid a tax to the government. If the quantity of government pruchases was fixed, it amounted to a lump sum tax which does not have adverse incentive effects. When the government was the seller of certain products at below market prices, as in the case of material inputs to state enterprises, the purchaser received a subsidy. If the quantity can be increased by negotiation, the purchaser would have an incentive to resell the extra quantities in the free market to make a profit. State enterprises receiving supplies from the government at below market prices dis resell some of the in markets; they also had a competitive edge over other enterprises not receiving the subsidy. Overall, it appeared that the ill-effects from subsidies might be outweighted by the positive effects of making the products available in free markets to benefit the consumers or producers. The Oct 1984 Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party singled out price reform as one of its important components. The decontrol and resetting of prices have continued until today.</p>
<p>As the sixth step in the reform process, China expaned foreign trade and encouraged foreign investment in an open-door policy.<br>Foreign trade and investments have performed three significant functions in China’s economic development.<br>First, foreign investment augments domestic investment in the process of capital accumulation while foreign trade expands China’s prodution possibility frontier inclusive of trade.<br>Second, foreign investment and trade are channels through which updated technology and management practices are introduced into China in the process of learning by doing.<br>Third, and not the least, joint ventures, foreign enterprises, and foreign trade provide competition to Chinese state and collective enterprises, forcing them to be more efficient and at the same time putting pressure on the Chinese price system to reflect the forces of demand and supply.</p>
<p>In Oct 1992, some fourteen years after the official begining of economic reform introduced by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party in 1978, the Congress of the Communist Party was able to adopt a resolution moved by Deng Xiaoping to declare that China’s national output was produced by profit-seeking economic units. In 1992, real national income increased by 12 percent by official statistics,, with most observers projecting a 10-year growth rate averaging 7 to 9 percent. Private enterprises were flourishing. China had already become essentially a market economy.</p>
<p>While meeting with Secretary-General Zhao on Thursday, November 3, 1988, I discussed the possibility of having more political freedom, including freedom of speech, of publication and of assembly, and the possibility of promoting the respect for law in China. The Secretary-General believes that China can make progress towards having more political freedom and respect for the law, but the process, as I see it, is probably going to be slow given China’s historical and political background. After the meeting, it become clear to me that if Mainland China practiced political freedom and the respect for the law, which is being practiced in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong people would increase their confidence in the government of the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Concerning foreign investment, I wrote in Princeton Alumni Weekly (Sept. 1989) that ‘New Foreign investment has slackened not because of morality, but because investors are recalculating their risks. As long as investors believe that investment in China will be profitable and not unduly risky, they will continue to invest.’ This applies especially to the people in Hong Kong and Taiwan, even though they had much stronger emotional reaction to Tiananmen Square than others. Economic dependence on China is stronger in these two lands than elsewhere. Using low-cost labor in China, manufactures in Hong Kong and Taiwan can compete effectively in the world market, so their entrepreneurs have powerful incentives to maintain their manufacturing facilities in China and to establish new ones. Investment and trade from other Asian nations, including Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, have been affected only slightly by the unrest.</p>
<p>Inflation means rapid increase in the general price level. The price level can be measured by a price index which is an average of the prices of many commodities at a given time, as compared with similar average at a base period. Two commonly used general price indices in the United States are the consumer price index (CPI) and the Gross National Product (GNP) deflator. The former is the average price of a standard bundle of consumer goods used by a typical household. It measures how the monetary cost of living of such households changes. The latter is an average of the prices of all commodities (including producer goods as well as consumer goods) and services that are produced by an economy in a given period. Its increase provides a broader definition of inflation than the increase in the CPI.</p>
<p>Since price is an exchange rate between units of money and units of a physical commodity or a service, prices would rise if there are more units of money chasing after (offered to buy) the same quantites of physical commodities and services.</p>
<p>Most economists agree that without going through the increase in money supply the other causes cannot generate inflation.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1988 when inflation became serious, the government tried to restrict the increase in money and credit by assiging credit quotas to banks in different regions and provinces. In addition interest rates on bank deposits were raised to attract deposits and to reduce the quantity of money in circulation, thus making the price level lower than otherwise. Although administrative means such as the assignment of credit quotas to banks were employed because of the absence of a modern banking system for monetary control by economic means, the Chinese officials did use some economic tools such as raising interest rates to control inflation.</p>
<p>In summary, historical records on the policies to deal with inflation in 1985, 1988 and 1993 show that the Chinese government was able to control inflation each time. The question is, will the Chinese government continue to do so in the future, at least in the remaining years of the 1990s. My answer is a qualified yes, subject to some uncertainty.</p>
<p>We understand that monetary stimulation can be successful only if applied occasionally and under the environment of a stable price level. As Milton Friedman has put the point aptly by an analogy. Increasing money supply to an economy is like feeding alcoholic drinks to a person. A small quantity used when the economy or the person is in a normal and stable condition does sometimes help to stimulate, but continued usage of a large quantity will lead to malfunctioning and collapse. I hope that most Chinese government officials appreciate this point. </p>
<p>One element that affects the quality of some Chinese economic statistics from the viewpoint of the user is the incomplete description of the method of construction. Examples are price indexes and indexes of national income in constant prices of selected years. Documentation and description of sources and methods of construction for national income data are much less detailed than can be found in the statistical appendixes of the ‘National Income’ issues of the Survey of Current Business. The poor standard of documentation is one aspect of the underdeveloped state of statistical work in China. In addition, detailed documentation of certain statistical series may reveal information regarded as confidential by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Therefore, in computing national output in 1952 prices, the relative weight given to industrial output compared with agricultural output is about three times the relative weight applied when 1980 prices are used. Chow (1985) estimated the annual growth rate of industry to be about 11% and that of agriculture and other sectors to be about 1.9%, using official data. A large weight given to industry can produce a high rate of growth of 6.0% per year. By using 1980 prices and thus giving a small weight to industrial output, one would obtain an average rate of growth in real national income between 1952 and 1980 of 3.9% per year iinstead of 6.0%. The 3.9% growth rate is more meaningful because the high prices assigned to industrial products in 1952 are arbitrary and because the growth of future real output will be measured by using prices close to 1980 prices. It is interesting to note that, according to the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States (1979), Gross National Product of the People’s Republic of China was estimated to be $99 billion in 1952 and $444 billion in 1978, implying an annual growth rate of 5.94%.</p>

<p>A major landmark of economic reform was the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist party of China on Reform of the Economic Structure of Oct 20, 1984. The decision includes the following major components concerning the operation of the domestic economy.<br>First, we should extend the decision-making power of enterprises owned by the whole people… on the premise of following the state plans and subjecting itself to state control, the enterprise has the power to adopt flexible and diversified forms of operation; plans its production, supply and marketing; keep and budget funds it is entitled to retain; appoint, remove, employ or elect its own personnel according to its relevant regulations; decide on how to recruit and use its work force, ad on wages and rewards; set the prices of its products within the limits prescribed by the state; and so on. In short, the enterprise should be truly made a relatively independent economic entity and … responsible for its own profit ad loss and … act as a legal person with certain rights and duties.<br>Second, concerning central planning, the ‘socialist state institutions must manage, inspect, guide and regulate the activities of the enterprises, as is necessary, through planning and by economic, administrative and legal means; … it must designate, appoint and remove the principle leading members of the enterprises or approve their appointment and election … for a considerably long time to come, our national economic plans on the whole can only be rough and elastic and … we can do no more than, by striking an overall balance in planninng and through regulation by economic means, exercise effective control over major issues while allowing flexibility on minor ones … the socialist planned economy is a planned commodity economy based on public ownership, in which the law of value must be consciously followed and applied. ‘<br>Third, concerning price reform, ‘The irrational system of pricing is closely related to the irrational system of price control. In readjusting prices, we must reform the over-centralized system of price control, gradually reducing the scope of uniform prices set by the state and appropriately enlarging the scope of floating prices within certain limits and of free prices. Thus prices will respond rather quickly to changes in labor productivity and the relation between market supply and demand …’ However, market price determination was somewhat restricted. ‘All enterprises should achieve better economic results through efforts to improve management and operation and should never try to increase their income by price increases. It is absolutely impermissible for any unit or person to boost prices at a general rise in prices, disrupt the socialist market and harm the interests of the states and the consumers.’ The Decision also allowed the market sector of collective and individual enterprises to expand. Wage rates were to be differentiated enough ‘to apply fully the principle of rewarding the diligent and good, punishing the lazy and bad, and of giving more pay for more work and less pay for less work …’</p>
<p>A slogan used by Chiese reform officials since 1985 was ‘Invigorate the microeconomic units and control by macroeconomic means.’ This is another way of describing the policy stated in the Decision of Oct 1984 to change from compulsory planning to guidance planning: ‘A planned economy does not necessarily mean the predominance of mandatory planning, both mandatory and guidance planning being its specific forms … guidance plans are fulfilled mainly by use of economic levers; mandatory plans have to be implemented, but even then the law of value must be observed.’</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the present Chinese economic system, with proper management, is capable of achieving a fairly high level of performance to generate a reasonably rapid rate of economic development. This conclusion is based on the following three propositions, each to be discussed in turn.<br>Proposition 1.<br>A decentralized socialist market economy, of properly designed, can perform somewhat between 60 and 100 percent as efficiently as a capitalist market economy. By ‘60 percent efficiency’ is meant producing 60 percent of the output using the same amount of resources.</p>
<p>Proposition 2.<br>The combination of economic planning with market socialism or capitalism can make the economic system work about as well, if not better, than pure market socialism or capitalism.</p>
<p>Proposition 3.<br>Monopolistic and rent-seeking behavior on the part of state enterprise managers and government bureaucrats in China affects the distribution of income but might not seriously affect the efficient working of the market.</p>
<p>The fact that the Chinese economy has grown substantially in the last decade is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that it will grow at similar rates in the next two decades. Some reservations have been voiced.<br>First, the economic momentum generated by the reform will run out of steam. In particular, reform in agriculture increased efficiency in terms of rasing output per capita as compared with farming under Commune system, but once the level of output per capita is raised, no further increase is expected. In fact, the record of agricultural output since 1985 has ben poor. This is a valid point, except that the energy of the farmers unleashed by the present system (in spite of the uncertainty about the right of long-term land use) has been applied to work in light industry, and in commercial and other more productive pursuits in the rural areas, and that the process of technological change in the form of the changing occupation and production mix in China’s countryside has continued and is expected to continue, thus helping to raise output per capita in rural areas.<br>Second, inexperienced macroeconomic management in an environment of imperfect macroeconomic institutions may destroy the economic fabric for further growth. This is a serious possibility. Like other observers, I am concerned about the current inflation, but it is my judgement that the Chinese government will succeed in preventing it from getting out of hand, even if some arbitrary controls might be applied and the progress of price reform might be slower than in the absence of inflation. Like many economists who appreciate the distinction between the flexibility of relative prices and the control of the (average) price index, I believe that it is possible for the Chinese government to control inflation whlie allowing prices of individual products to remain fairly free.<br>One well-known experience is the control of the inflation in Taiwan in the 1950s, when aggregate demand for consumer goods and the velocity of currency circulation were reduced significantly by raising the rates of interest, following advice given by Sho-chieh Tsiang to the Taiwan government.<br>High interest rates as recommended above, in order to be effective, have to be accompanied by stopping the rapid increase in money supply.<br>Third, some observers are concerned that the reform process will stop. As I have argued above, reasonable economic progress in China can occur without significant further reforms in economic institutions. The present system is good enough, although it can be better under Chinese socialism as put forward by the October 1984 Decision. Supporting this argument further is the open-door policy, which will continue to provide energy to China’s economic growth of foreign in the form of capital and technology import, and of setting examples for and providing competition to Chinese State enterprises. The contribution to economic growth of foreign investment, and of collective and private enterprises, has been evident in the province of Guangdong, neighboring Hong Kong.</p>
<p>China may be slow in correcting the present deficiencies of the economic system. These deficiencies include the dependency of labor on the iron rice bowl, the dependency of state enterprises on the government for financial help, a certain amount of corruption, the lack of proficiency in economic planning and macroeconomic management, and the poor environment for foreign investment.</p>
<p>It is my conclusion that market socialism combined with a certain degree of central planning will succeed in modernizing China. This conclusion does not rule out the possibility that capitalism may be better than socialism under other circumstances. Most people living in a capitalist society prefer capitalism as a form of economic organization. China has a very different historical experience from the United States. How feasible and desirable capitalism is under China’s political and economic situation are difficult questions to answer. Many Chinese leaders believe that socialism is more desirable for China, although many young people in China are questioning this view. Since the end of the Second World War, under the leadership of the United States and Soviet Union, capitalist and communist countries have been engaged in a cold war. People and intellectuals on each side have criticized the other system while arguing the superiority of their own. The Chinese economic experiment, by combining socialism with market incentives, may help resolve the conflict in economic ideas and hasten the end of the Cold War. </p>
<p>The hypothesis of asset management:<br>A person managing an asset will, to the best of his or her knowledge, try to derive the most benefit from it, in (a) utilizing its services directly himself or herself, (b) allowing others to use its services, or (c) delivering it to others.</p>
<p>Law of supply of asset service<br>When the marginal benefit from providing the service of an asset is smaller (larger), the asset manager will supply less (more) of its service.</p>
<p>Law of asset delivery<br>When the marginal benefit from delivery or surrending an asset to others is smaller (larger), the asset manager will be less (more) willing to deliver it, possibly reducing the qualities of delivery in the form of delays or lower product quality.</p>
<p>Law of asset maintenance<br>When the benefit of managing an asset, either through the use of its service or through surrending it to others, is smaller (larger), the manager will be less (more) willing to maintain it or to improve upon it.</p>
<p>Law of rent seeking<br>When opportunities to extract payment or benefit from providing the service of an asset or from delivering it to others are available and not unduly risky, the manager will take advantage of them.</p>
<p>First, financial items are not included in the objective function so that there is no reason to economize on the use of inputs. Second, insofar as an increase of output is desirable and can be achieved by an increase of the use of inputs, there is an incentive for the manager to negotiate for more material and other inputs, hence the soft-budget constraint.</p>
<p>The differences in behavior between model A under central planning and model B prevailing after urban economic reforms in 1980s are that in the latter case there is a tendency to maximize profits by increasing management effort, and that there is a tendency to economize on the use of material inputs because profits enter the objective function of the manager. Note, however, that these tendencies are weak if the relative elasticity parameter θ is large, reflecting the unimportance of marginal profits in the manager’s utility function. This is the case for large and medium-size state enterprises, as compared with small state enterprises. In large state enterprises, marginal profits yield only small benefits to the manager, after an allowable amount of profit has been used for distribution as bonuses to management, staff and workers, both in cash and in the form of consumer durables. By contrast, the high profit incentive for the owner-manager of a private enterprise in a market economy is captured in model B, with θ set equal to zero. The appropriate link between marginal profts and the manager’s marginal benefits remains a serious problem in enterprise reform in China.</p>
<p>If one accepts the empirical finding of no technological change in China from 1952 to 1980, one may try to explain why it happened. It is an accepted fact that the Chinese economic planners tried to introduce industrial technology and the method of planning from the Soviet Union in the 1950s and began the First Five-Year Plan in 1953. The Chinese planners also tried to increase output by investing a large fraction of national output in industry, especially heavy industry. This paper has described the increases in outputs in five sectors and in total through capital formation in these sectors by using sectorial and aggregate production functions. These is no reason to assume that technological progress occurred during the period up to 1980. Economic cooperation with the Soviet Union ended in the 1960s. Without incentives from private enterprises to innovate, where could technological progress have come? I have found no theory to support the assertion that central planning will produce technological progress. It might happen, as suggested by Young [1992] for the case of Singapore, that much government direction in industrial investment does not lead to an increase in total factor productivity. Although technological progress defined in the context of Solow’s [1956] growth model is an important phenomenon to explain for a market economy like the United States, one cannot presume its existence in a country like China during a period when private initiatives for innovations or adopting new technology from abroad appeared to be absent. For such an economy one does not need to find explanations for the varying rates of productivity changes as Romer [1987] attempted to do for the United States. However, after the reforms in the 1980s when profit-seeking enterprises began to grow, the study of technological progress in China is an important and interesting topic for further research.</p>
