        <p>The two well-known approaches to business cycles, the New Classical and the New Keynesian approaches, both model expansions and contractions as being due to exogenous factors, although the New Keynesian approach does show that an underemployment equilibrium can occur through optimizing choices, which makes the underemployment equilibrium or the recession to be caused by endogenous factors. However, the expansion is usually caused by exogenous factors, such as an increase in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>The case for studying business cycles that are endogenously generated has been eloquently made by Geoffrey Moore (1977, p.97), an authority on business cycles: ‘accidents’ like a big strike, a new discovery, an oil embargo, a very poor (or a very good) harvest, or a declaration of war or peace can precipitate both upturns and downturns; and that long-term growth affects the entire cycle.</p>
<p>Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occuring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic; in duration business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years; they are not divisible into shorter cycles of similar character with amplitudes approximating their own. (Burns and Micchell, 1946)</p>
<p>General equilibrium is a good description of market exchange when endowments are given and trade occurs only after a vector of equilibrium prices has been found. Is it possible that when trade (a) is in produced goods and not initial endowments, and (b) occurs in ‘disequilibrium’, or before an equilibrium vector of prices is found, the sort of cycles described in the Burns-Mitchell definiion cannot be avoided?</p>
<p>For twentieth-century cycles, especially those observed in market economies after World War II, the most striking stylized facts about business cycles are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fluctuating growth of output is accompanied by a procyclical inflation rate and an inverse relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate; that is, the inflation rate is anticyclical with the unemployment rate.</li>
<li>The comovement of price inflation with wage inflation, with the latter usually leading the former except during periods of very rapid inflation.</li>
<li>Procyclical real wages indicating that the wage share out of national income is also procyclical. Consequently, at cyclical peaks the profit share, defined as one minus the wage share, is generally low.</li>
<li>A long-term positive trend rate of growth trough of real GNP or GDP. This implies each subsequent cyclical trough of GNP (GDP) does not cancel out the ‘gains’ made by the previous cyclical peak. This has led to the growing acceptance of the Schumpeterian view that growth and cycle are inextricably interwined, and that the cycle is growth and cycle are inextricably interwined, and that the cycle is a necessary condition for growth and vice versa. This view is also associated with Harrod (1936) and Goodwin (1982).</li>
<li>Recurrent but nonperiodic cycles. This suggests that although we can compute the average duration of  large number of cycles, as done by researchers at the NBER, no two cycles ever appear to be of equal duration. Consequently, turning points cannot be predicted.</li>
<li>A procyclical relationship between labor productivity and output. (Incidentally, this rules out the standard neoclassical aggregate production function, with a declinig marginal product of labor, as part of a business cycle theory.)</li>
<li>The general procyclical nature of profits. In particular, before sales decline, profits per unit of sales decline.</li>
<li>Procyclical nature of investment in fixed capital and inventories. Although this is well established for the typical cycle, there are individual components that either lead or lag behind in the cycle.</li>
<li>Procyclical expansion of credit and monetary aggregates. During contractions, both narrowly and broadly defined monetary aggregates show reduced growth rates, but not absolute declines. This implies that the income velocity of money is also procyclical.</li>
<li>The synchronization of international cycles, a tendency that may well intensify in the future. Institutional changes such as free capital mobility, floating exchange rates, and the increase in international arbitrage and speculative activities have increased interdependence among the major capitalist nations, which is likely to lead to a further synchronization of cycles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cycles that are recurrent but nonperiodic make decisions risky and creat an exposure to unemployment and bankruptcy (Gordon, 1986). Workers cannot predict when layoff may eliminate the extra income needed to meet some debt obligation (for a mortgage or a consumer durable). Similarly, firms cannot predict whether an expansion to a plant undertaken now will be justified through increased slaes due to general prosperity or whether the increased sales will fail to materialize due to the onset of a recession. If a recession does occur, the carrying costs of the expanded plant may exceed the marginal increase in sales revenue. Furthermore, firms cannot shift to other activities because the recession typically affects many economic activities, as the Burns-Mitchell definition makes clear.</p>
<p>As noted above, the truth content of many physical theories is often confirmed through experimentation. The truth content of ‘grand theories’ is much more difficult to establish. Newtonian physics ‘worked’ perfectly well to a first approximation, until generalized by Einstein, when Newtonian physics became a special case of Einstein’s more general theory. In economics, grand theories such as the Walrasian general equilibrium theory or the labor theory of value are themselves mental constructs whose truth content cannot be confirmed in any meaningful sense. The Walrasian model is the model of an auction; the actual economy does not behave like an auction, although auctions do take place in the economy. The value of general equilibrium theory is that of a counterfactual: if an economy were perfectly competitive, with no frictions, and there were complete markets for all contingencies, then all prices would reflect true opportunity costs, etc. It is no more than a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Similarly the labor theory of value is a ‘grand theory’ that is a counterfactual thought experiment: if all goods were produced with other produced goods and labor, then the prices of all goods would reflect their direct and indirect labor content.</p>
<p>Of course, a number of econometricians (e.g. Leamer, 1983; Hendry and Ericsson, 1991; Pagan, 1987) are deeply concerned about the abuse of econometrics. Hendry and Ericsson (1991) in particular have articulated a rigorous econometric methodology that pays a great deal of attention to specification testing. They have set down a set of six criteria that must be satisfied in order that a model may capture the salient features of the data and deliver reliable inferences on economic issues; it may however, take a while before that method is adopted by applied econometricians.</p>
