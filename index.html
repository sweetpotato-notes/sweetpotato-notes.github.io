        <p>The economist has no choice but to study dynamics; for otherwise there is little possibility of presenting a reasonably realistic description of such phenomena as speculation, cyclical fluctuations, and secular growth. In addition, dynamic process analysis is an enormously flexible mode of thought, both for pinning down the implications of various hypotheses and for investigating new possibilities.</p>
<p>In the field of pure theory, the important problem of stability of equilibrium is wholly a question of dynamics. For it involves the question of how a system behaves after it has been disturbed into a disequilibrium state. The problem of stability of equilibrium cannot be meaningfully considered without explicitly specifying the dynamics of the adjustment process. For the comparative statics analysis to yield fruitful results we must first develop a theory of dynamics.</p>
<p>Indeed, the genesis of the real dynamic stability analysis can be traced to Samuelson’s specification, in his pioneering 1941 work on the relevance of dynamics for statics, of the necessary and sufficient conditions for stability.</p>
<p>If capitalism is efficient and is not politically stable, then one must contemplate a temptation toward an imposed capitalism… If democracy cannot be trusted, write once and forever into the constitution that capitalism must be the law of the land – that’s where conservatives are now trying to go.</p>
<p>On capital theory, which may properly be regarded as the study of efficient intertemporal production; on induced innovation; and on elasticities of substitution. Finally, although Samuelson never did much empirical work himself, his constant insistence on ‘operational meaningfulness’ of theorems focused attention on their empirical refutability and provided a major impetus for the econometric analysis of production.</p>
<p>I do not think that the real stumbling block has been the failure of a literary writer to understand that when a mathematician says, ‘y rises as x falls,’ he is implying nothing about temporal sequences or anything different from ‘when x is low, y is high.’</p>
<p>Considering the prominent part played by increasing returns in past discussions of growth since Adam Smith, the mainstream of the recent neoclassical theory has neglected it to a surprising extent… The reason for the neglect is no doubt the difficulty of fitting increasing returns into the prevailing framework of perfect competition and marginal productivity pricing.</p>
<p>Adam Smith’s famous theorem that the division of labour depends upon the extent of the market. That theorem, I have always thought, is one of the most illuminating and fruitful generalizations which can be found anywhere in the whole literature of economic. </p>
<p>The statical theory of equilibrium is only an introduction to economic studies; and it is barely even an introduction to the study of the progress and development of industries which show a tendency to increasing return. Its limitations are so constantly overlooked, especially by those who approach it from an abstract point of view.</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief it is sometimes easier to talk in mathematics than to talk in English; this is the reason why many scientific papers contain more mathematics than is either necessary or desirable. Contrary to common belief it is also less precise to do so. For mathematical symbols have a tendency to conceal the physical meaning that they are intended to represent; they sometimes serve as a substitute for the arduous task of deciding what is and what is not relevant… It is true that mathematics cannot lie. But it can mislead.<br>However, the dangers of over-indulgence in formula spinning are avoided if mathematics is treated, wherever possible, as a language into which thoughts may only be translated after they have first been clearly expressed in the language of words. The use of mathematics in this way is indeed disciplinary, helpful, and sometimes indispensible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Neoclassical economics.<br>Im my case this involves a special affinity for the Chicago School. Actually I think there are two Chicago Schools. The older group tended to be price-level stabilizers in macroeconomic policy and trustbusteers in microeconomic policy. The younger group – my approximate contemporaries and their own students – repy on monetary rules on the macro side and worry less about monopoly on the micro side.</li>
<li>The Keynesian tradition, which differs significantly from principle 1, at least for me, by casting doubt on both the macroeconomy’s basic stabiity and its tendency to any full-employment equilibrium position.</li>
<li>The Marxian tradition, more in ‘the other social science’, including economic history, than in economics proper.</li>
<li>A number of historical and institutional schools, all of which try to look at economic and social history and development from the viewpoinnt of ‘what actually happened, and why’ rather than as hindsight illustrations of preconceived general and nonhistorical theories.</li>
<li>Behavioral schools, particularly my former Carnegie-Mellon colleagues, who doubt the realism and usefulness of assuming ‘maximizing’ or ‘optimizing’ or otherwise ‘rational’ behavior in social or economic matters and rely on primarily empirical (meaning statistical) routines and regularities, especially in considering short-run problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most famous passage in John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money had turned out to be its final paragraph, which has nothing to do with employment, interest, or money; I reproduce a lengthy excerpt:<br>The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas. Not, indeed, immediately, but after a certain interval; for in th field of economic and political philosophy there are not many who are influenced by new theories after they are twenty-five or thirty years of age, so that the ideas which civil servants and politicians and even agitators apply to current events are not likely to be the newest. But, soon or late, it is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.</p>
<p>Once we introduce systematically into a post-Keynesian system treatment of stocks of assets, monetary and real, and take into account fluctuating levels of real unemployment, there remain no inconsistencies between the classical system and the Keynesian system. The synthesis of common content emerges with an eclectic position on the interplay of real and monetary factors in determining the structure and levels of interest rates.</p>
<p>Modern economic analysis does provide us with a ‘neoclassical synthesis’ that combines the essentials of the theory of aggregative income determination with the older classical theories of relative prices and of microeconomics. In a well-running system, with monetary and fiscal policies operating to validate the high-employment assumption postulated by the classical theory, that classical theory comes back into its own, and the economist feels he can state with renewed conviction the classic truths and principles of social economy.</p>
<p>No one can predict with certainty whether fluctuations in autonomous private investment will be sharp or mild in the years ahead or whether non-fiscal programs can be counted on to reduce their residual fluctuation down to a broad or narrow range; thus the neoclassical doctrine does not tell us whether the indicated optimal pattern of cyclical fluctution of government expenditure will be sharp or mild.</p>
<p>Expansionary monetary policies that keep investment spending higher than would otherwise be the case lead initially to lower money rates of interest and ultimately to lower real-productivity yields on the enhanced stock of physical capital equipment. But they achieve this not at all at the expense of current consumption, for consumption too is higher than would otherwise be the case. Both capital formation and consumption can be increased by utilizing resources that would otherwise be dissipated in mass unemployment and industrial excess capacity.</p>
<p>The weight of evidence suggests to me that there are deep-seated causes for the Lorentz-Pareto distributions of actual income. They can be changed (for good and evil) by government policies and by trade-union and other collusions. But they do stubbornly resist such changes in their real magnitudes, and their laws of motion over time seem to me to be best understood and forecasted in terms of hypotheses about relative factor supplies, the nature of technological invention and innovation, and (to a lesser degree) in terms of changes in the degree of imperfection of competition in commodity and factor markets.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of statistical Philips curve the data for the years 1980-2000 actually produce, the policymakers’ trade-off between inflation and unemployment will persist until some finds a reliable way to manipulate aggregate supply. The limited capability of policy to influence supply poses a particularly vexing problem in a stagflationary world since any stabilization policy adopted in response to stagflation is bound to aggravate one of the problems even as it helps cure the other. Such is the policy dilemma of stagflation.</p>
<p>I am not persuaded by the force of theoretical argument, or by the statistical and historical data so far available for different mixed economies, that even in the longest run the benefits to be derived from militant anti-inflationary polices don’t carry excessive costs as far as average levels of unemployment and growth are concerned. And even if the benefits did decisively outweigh the costs in the longest run, history is a onetime thing and mankind at this stage of the game can ill afford to make irreversible academic experiments whose outcomes are necessarily doubtful and whose execution could put strains on the already-strained political consensus of modern nations.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the neoclassical synthesis was not really a synthesis of neoclassical with Keynesian ideas… but merely the reassertion of the neoclassical framework with the addition of some Keynesian ‘macro’ ternimology. The flavor of some of Keynes’ specific policy recommendations was retained, but the essential logic of Keynes’ economic theory was discarded. Thus the neoclassical synthesis had the result that the fundamental Keynesian revolution was aborted.</p>
<p>Consider what was the point of the Keynesian revolution on the plane of theory and on the plane of policy. On the plane of theory, the main point of the General Theory was to break out of the cocoon of equilibrium and consider the nature of life lived in time – the difference between yesterday and tomorrow. Here and now, the past is irrevocable ad the future is unknown.</p>
<p>The neoclassical picture leads one to analyze markets in terms of harmony and optimization. Marx’s approach takes one beneath the surface to class conflict at the point of production and relates this to the circulation of capital (the turnover between money-form and commodity-form), the interdependence of sectors, and the appropriation of the surplus in the form of profits. This provides the foundation for a political analysis of economic relationships.</p>

        <p>While both the Walrasian and Post Walrasian approaches assume rational agents, they differ in the environment in which they model the interaction of those agents. To make its models tractable, the DSGE approach, which is the culmination of the Walrasian modeling tradition, assumes either that agents operate in an information-rich environment or that there is an outside controller who processes all information. The Post Walrasian model, which this collection explores, assumes that agents operate in information-poor environments, without any outside controller.</p>
<p>In the past those who had been brought up in the Walrasian General Equilibrium tradition considered the field of Macroeconomics as essentially corresponding to the problem of aggregation. What meaningful relationships, they asked, among aggregate variables could be established starting from a set of independent utility maximizing individuals. This has not always been the case.<br>Generally, to avoid the aggregation problem, the aggregate data are treated as if they were the result of one individual’s decisions. This, as is well known, is not legitimate from a theoretical point of view. Indeed, in the DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) synthesis the problem is not solved, just treated as if it were solved.</p>
<p>The attempt is heroic, and is only in the beginning stages. So a key question posed throughout the book is: What are the basic ingredients that we require from an alternative view? Given that this question is central, in this foreword I will suggest those themes that I believe should be included. I would include four main themes.<br>First, we would like to model the economy as a system in which there is a direct interaction among individuals. We would like to specify agents who, in a sense, have local as opposed to global knowledge. It may well be the case that they have a limited, even wrong, view of the world.<br>Second, we should require that agents behave in a ‘reasonable’ but not ‘optimal’ way; for example, they may use simple rules and they should not act against their own interests. Moreover, these reasonable agents should evolve in the sense that they learn from previous experience.<br>Third, the system should function over time but without necessarily converging to any particular state. It would be good to have a different notion of equilibrium from the standard one, a notion that corresponds to an economy that is in continual movement.<br>Finally, whatever model we develop should have some testable conclusions; we should be able to imagine some empirical evidence that would lead us to refute our model.</p>
<p>Jordan’s view of the Walrasian system is more abstract and precise. It assumes a central processor of information, which does the calculations, leaving the agents simply to react to the prices they face. For Colander the Walrasian agents incorporate all the processing capabilities required of the system – each is a central processor in its own right. From the Jordan perspective, there is a central processor who does all the work for them.<br>The problem with the informal Walrasian tradition is that it skips over the discussion of how, pricesely, prices are arrived at, or simply assumes ‘price taking’ behavior without answering the question of what ‘price taking’ can mean if all the agents are doing the information processing themselves.<br>The central goal of work within this formal Walrasian framework is to find a set of prices for which aggregate excess demand is zero for all goods. Yet, demand is not even defined unless prices are given. Thus within the strict Arrow-Debreu framework we have to assume that someone other than the agent is setting the prices. This is neither realistic nor philosophically satisfactory but is, I believe, why the Walrasian literature has retained what we can call the Jordan perspective.</p>
<p>So, despite their seeming differences, both perspectives lead to the same place in terms of the need for change and in the direction of future research. They both direct researchers toward constructing a more realistic model of how information is processed by individuals and how they manage to coordinate their different wants.</p>
<p>This recall work by Kalai and Lerner (1993) who showed that, if people are to converge, through learning, on and equilibrium, their initial views of the world have to have something in common. (The condition they use is technical and essentially means that players cannot assign zero probabilities to any of the outcomes of the game that are actually possible.) This brings up a crucial problem when dealing with heterogeneous agents who have, in particular, differing beliefs about the world in which they function. If agents have a totally false idea of reality there is little hope for convergence to an equilibrium of the ‘true’ model.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this I am reiterating many of the points made by Branch. As he shows, heterogeneity of expectations can arise in a misspecified equilibrium situation. Such results are reassuring for those who have been puzzled by the persistent empirical evidence for such heterogeneity of expctations. Perhaps the most important idea here is that we should not regard learning as a way of justifying the static or steady state equilibrium that we are interested in, but we should accept that the learning process itself may lead the economy to have interesting dynamics that do not converge to an equilibrium in the standard sense.</p>
<p>LeBaron’s contribution to the volume captures some of the insights of models of financial markets in which individuals change their forecasts as a result of the opinions of their neighbors or as a result of their own experience. These models demonstrate that the population of traders will likely switch from forecasting in one way to another and that these switches will be reinforced by the feedback into prices. As a result, as the population of traders changes from being dominated by one type of forecast based on fundamentals, for example, to another type based perhaps on extrapolation, bubbles and crashes will occur.</p>
<p>Since there is no equilibrium in the standard sense, the question then is: Can we find some sort of equilibrium notion, or do we have to content ourselves with saying that ‘anything can happen.’ In Follmer, Horst, and Kirman (2005) we suggest such an alternative notion. Although prices are constantly changing and never settle to any steady state, we can show that the time aveages of prices will converge, that the process is ergodic, and that a unique limit price distribution will exist. Thus, despite complicated dynamics, there is some structure in the evolution of prices such that, though they never settle down, it is an appropriate concept of equilibrium. Why is this interesting? Because I think this gives us an idea of equilibrium that is not Walrasian in the usual sense, but is specifiable and consistent with the empirical evidence because it also allows us to explain a number of the stylized facts in financial time series such as ‘fat tails’ and ‘long memory.’</p>
<p>Dynamics are important, and assuming away the possibilities of internally generated bubbles in one’s models, as is done by most DSGE models, will give us little insight into how to deal with such bubbles should they actually occur.</p>
