            <p>The economist has no choice but to study dynamics; for otherwise there is little possibility of presenting a reasonably realistic description of such phenomena as speculation, cyclical fluctuations, and secular growth. In addition, dynamic process analysis is an enormously flexible mode of thought, both for pinning down the implications of various hypotheses and for investigating new possibilities.</p>
<p>In the field of pure theory, the important problem of stability of equilibrium is wholly a question of dynamics. For it involves the question of how a system behaves after it has been disturbed into a disequilibrium state. The problem of stability of equilibrium cannot be meaningfully considered without explicitly specifying the dynamics of the adjustment process. For the comparative statics analysis to yield fruitful results we must first develop a theory of dynamics.</p>
<p>Indeed, the genesis of the real dynamic stability analysis can be traced to Samuelson’s specification, in his pioneering 1941 work on the relevance of dynamics for statics, of the necessary and sufficient conditions for stability.</p>
<p>If capitalism is efficient and is not politically stable, then one must contemplate a temptation toward an imposed capitalism… If democracy cannot be trusted, write once and forever into the constitution that capitalism must be the law of the land – that’s where conservatives are now trying to go.</p>
<p>On capital theory, which may properly be regarded as the study of efficient intertemporal production; on induced innovation; and on elasticities of substitution. Finally, although Samuelson never did much empirical work himself, his constant insistence on ‘operational meaningfulness’ of theorems focused attention on their empirical refutability and provided a major impetus for the econometric analysis of production.</p>
<p>I do not think that the real stumbling block has been the failure of a literary writer to understand that when a mathematician says, ‘y rises as x falls,’ he is implying nothing about temporal sequences or anything different from ‘when x is low, y is high.’</p>
<p>Considering the prominent part played by increasing returns in past discussions of growth since Adam Smith, the mainstream of the recent neoclassical theory has neglected it to a surprising extent… The reason for the neglect is no doubt the difficulty of fitting increasing returns into the prevailing framework of perfect competition and marginal productivity pricing.</p>
<p>Adam Smith’s famous theorem that the division of labour depends upon the extent of the market. That theorem, I have always thought, is one of the most illuminating and fruitful generalizations which can be found anywhere in the whole literature of economic. </p>
<p>The statical theory of equilibrium is only an introduction to economic studies; and it is barely even an introduction to the study of the progress and development of industries which show a tendency to increasing return. Its limitations are so constantly overlooked, especially by those who approach it from an abstract point of view.</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief it is sometimes easier to talk in mathematics than to talk in English; this is the reason why many scientific papers contain more mathematics than is either necessary or desirable. Contrary to common belief it is also less precise to do so. For mathematical symbols have a tendency to conceal the physical meaning that they are intended to represent; they sometimes serve as a substitute for the arduous task of deciding what is and what is not relevant… It is true that mathematics cannot lie. But it can mislead.<br>However, the dangers of over-indulgence in formula spinning are avoided if mathematics is treated, wherever possible, as a language into which thoughts may only be translated after they have first been clearly expressed in the language of words. The use of mathematics in this way is indeed disciplinary, helpful, and sometimes indispensible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Neoclassical economics.<br>Im my case this involves a special affinity for the Chicago School. Actually I think there are two Chicago Schools. The older group tended to be price-level stabilizers in macroeconomic policy and trustbusteers in microeconomic policy. The younger group – my approximate contemporaries and their own students – repy on monetary rules on the macro side and worry less about monopoly on the micro side.</li>
<li>The Keynesian tradition, which differs significantly from principle 1, at least for me, by casting doubt on both the macroeconomy’s basic stabiity and its tendency to any full-employment equilibrium position.</li>
<li>The Marxian tradition, more in ‘the other social science’, including economic history, than in economics proper.</li>
<li>A number of historical and institutional schools, all of which try to look at economic and social history and development from the viewpoinnt of ‘what actually happened, and why’ rather than as hindsight illustrations of preconceived general and nonhistorical theories.</li>
<li>Behavioral schools, particularly my former Carnegie-Mellon colleagues, who doubt the realism and usefulness of assuming ‘maximizing’ or ‘optimizing’ or otherwise ‘rational’ behavior in social or economic matters and rely on primarily empirical (meaning statistical) routines and regularities, especially in considering short-run problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most famous passage in John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money had turned out to be its final paragraph, which has nothing to do with employment, interest, or money; I reproduce a lengthy excerpt:<br>The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas. Not, indeed, immediately, but after a certain interval; for in th field of economic and political philosophy there are not many who are influenced by new theories after they are twenty-five or thirty years of age, so that the ideas which civil servants and politicians and even agitators apply to current events are not likely to be the newest. But, soon or late, it is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.</p>
<p>Once we introduce systematically into a post-Keynesian system treatment of stocks of assets, monetary and real, and take into account fluctuating levels of real unemployment, there remain no inconsistencies between the classical system and the Keynesian system. The synthesis of common content emerges with an eclectic position on the interplay of real and monetary factors in determining the structure and levels of interest rates.</p>
<p>Modern economic analysis does provide us with a ‘neoclassical synthesis’ that combines the essentials of the theory of aggregative income determination with the older classical theories of relative prices and of microeconomics. In a well-running system, with monetary and fiscal policies operating to validate the high-employment assumption postulated by the classical theory, that classical theory comes back into its own, and the economist feels he can state with renewed conviction the classic truths and principles of social economy.</p>
<p>No one can predict with certainty whether fluctuations in autonomous private investment will be sharp or mild in the years ahead or whether non-fiscal programs can be counted on to reduce their residual fluctuation down to a broad or narrow range; thus the neoclassical doctrine does not tell us whether the indicated optimal pattern of cyclical fluctution of government expenditure will be sharp or mild.</p>
<p>Expansionary monetary policies that keep investment spending higher than would otherwise be the case lead initially to lower money rates of interest and ultimately to lower real-productivity yields on the enhanced stock of physical capital equipment. But they achieve this not at all at the expense of current consumption, for consumption too is higher than would otherwise be the case. Both capital formation and consumption can be increased by utilizing resources that would otherwise be dissipated in mass unemployment and industrial excess capacity.</p>
<p>The weight of evidence suggests to me that there are deep-seated causes for the Lorentz-Pareto distributions of actual income. They can be changed (for good and evil) by government policies and by trade-union and other collusions. But they do stubbornly resist such changes in their real magnitudes, and their laws of motion over time seem to me to be best understood and forecasted in terms of hypotheses about relative factor supplies, the nature of technological invention and innovation, and (to a lesser degree) in terms of changes in the degree of imperfection of competition in commodity and factor markets.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of statistical Philips curve the data for the years 1980-2000 actually produce, the policymakers’ trade-off between inflation and unemployment will persist until some finds a reliable way to manipulate aggregate supply. The limited capability of policy to influence supply poses a particularly vexing problem in a stagflationary world since any stabilization policy adopted in response to stagflation is bound to aggravate one of the problems even as it helps cure the other. Such is the policy dilemma of stagflation.</p>
<p>I am not persuaded by the force of theoretical argument, or by the statistical and historical data so far available for different mixed economies, that even in the longest run the benefits to be derived from militant anti-inflationary polices don’t carry excessive costs as far as average levels of unemployment and growth are concerned. And even if the benefits did decisively outweigh the costs in the longest run, history is a onetime thing and mankind at this stage of the game can ill afford to make irreversible academic experiments whose outcomes are necessarily doubtful and whose execution could put strains on the already-strained political consensus of modern nations.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the neoclassical synthesis was not really a synthesis of neoclassical with Keynesian ideas… but merely the reassertion of the neoclassical framework with the addition of some Keynesian ‘macro’ ternimology. The flavor of some of Keynes’ specific policy recommendations was retained, but the essential logic of Keynes’ economic theory was discarded. Thus the neoclassical synthesis had the result that the fundamental Keynesian revolution was aborted.</p>
<p>Consider what was the point of the Keynesian revolution on the plane of theory and on the plane of policy. On the plane of theory, the main point of the General Theory was to break out of the cocoon of equilibrium and consider the nature of life lived in time – the difference between yesterday and tomorrow. Here and now, the past is irrevocable ad the future is unknown.</p>
<p>The neoclassical picture leads one to analyze markets in terms of harmony and optimization. Marx’s approach takes one beneath the surface to class conflict at the point of production and relates this to the circulation of capital (the turnover between money-form and commodity-form), the interdependence of sectors, and the appropriation of the surplus in the form of profits. This provides the foundation for a political analysis of economic relationships.</p>

            <p>While both the Walrasian and Post Walrasian approaches assume rational agents, they differ in the environment in which they model the interaction of those agents. To make its models tractable, the DSGE approach, which is the culmination of the Walrasian modeling tradition, assumes either that agents operate in an information-rich environment or that there is an outside controller who processes all information. The Post Walrasian model, which this collection explores, assumes that agents operate in information-poor environments, without any outside controller.</p>
<p>In the past those who had been brought up in the Walrasian General Equilibrium tradition considered the field of Macroeconomics as essentially corresponding to the problem of aggregation. What meaningful relationships, they asked, among aggregate variables could be established starting from a set of independent utility maximizing individuals. This has not always been the case.<br>Generally, to avoid the aggregation problem, the aggregate data are treated as if they were the result of one individual’s decisions. This, as is well known, is not legitimate from a theoretical point of view. Indeed, in the DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) synthesis the problem is not solved, just treated as if it were solved.</p>
<p>The attempt is heroic, and is only in the beginning stages. So a key question posed throughout the book is: What are the basic ingredients that we require from an alternative view? Given that this question is central, in this foreword I will suggest those themes that I believe should be included. I would include four main themes.<br>First, we would like to model the economy as a system in which there is a direct interaction among individuals. We would like to specify agents who, in a sense, have local as opposed to global knowledge. It may well be the case that they have a limited, even wrong, view of the world.<br>Second, we should require that agents behave in a ‘reasonable’ but not ‘optimal’ way; for example, they may use simple rules and they should not act against their own interests. Moreover, these reasonable agents should evolve in the sense that they learn from previous experience.<br>Third, the system should function over time but without necessarily converging to any particular state. It would be good to have a different notion of equilibrium from the standard one, a notion that corresponds to an economy that is in continual movement.<br>Finally, whatever model we develop should have some testable conclusions; we should be able to imagine some empirical evidence that would lead us to refute our model.</p>
<p>Jordan’s view of the Walrasian system is more abstract and precise. It assumes a central processor of information, which does the calculations, leaving the agents simply to react to the prices they face. For Colander the Walrasian agents incorporate all the processing capabilities required of the system – each is a central processor in its own right. From the Jordan perspective, there is a central processor who does all the work for them.<br>The problem with the informal Walrasian tradition is that it skips over the discussion of how, pricesely, prices are arrived at, or simply assumes ‘price taking’ behavior without answering the question of what ‘price taking’ can mean if all the agents are doing the information processing themselves.<br>The central goal of work within this formal Walrasian framework is to find a set of prices for which aggregate excess demand is zero for all goods. Yet, demand is not even defined unless prices are given. Thus within the strict Arrow-Debreu framework we have to assume that someone other than the agent is setting the prices. This is neither realistic nor philosophically satisfactory but is, I believe, why the Walrasian literature has retained what we can call the Jordan perspective.</p>
<p>So, despite their seeming differences, both perspectives lead to the same place in terms of the need for change and in the direction of future research. They both direct researchers toward constructing a more realistic model of how information is processed by individuals and how they manage to coordinate their different wants.</p>
<p>This recall work by Kalai and Lerner (1993) who showed that, if people are to converge, through learning, on and equilibrium, their initial views of the world have to have something in common. (The condition they use is technical and essentially means that players cannot assign zero probabilities to any of the outcomes of the game that are actually possible.) This brings up a crucial problem when dealing with heterogeneous agents who have, in particular, differing beliefs about the world in which they function. If agents have a totally false idea of reality there is little hope for convergence to an equilibrium of the ‘true’ model.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this I am reiterating many of the points made by Branch. As he shows, heterogeneity of expectations can arise in a misspecified equilibrium situation. Such results are reassuring for those who have been puzzled by the persistent empirical evidence for such heterogeneity of expctations. Perhaps the most important idea here is that we should not regard learning as a way of justifying the static or steady state equilibrium that we are interested in, but we should accept that the learning process itself may lead the economy to have interesting dynamics that do not converge to an equilibrium in the standard sense.</p>
<p>LeBaron’s contribution to the volume captures some of the insights of models of financial markets in which individuals change their forecasts as a result of the opinions of their neighbors or as a result of their own experience. These models demonstrate that the population of traders will likely switch from forecasting in one way to another and that these switches will be reinforced by the feedback into prices. As a result, as the population of traders changes from being dominated by one type of forecast based on fundamentals, for example, to another type based perhaps on extrapolation, bubbles and crashes will occur.</p>
<p>Since there is no equilibrium in the standard sense, the question then is: Can we find some sort of equilibrium notion, or do we have to content ourselves with saying that ‘anything can happen.’ In Follmer, Horst, and Kirman (2005) we suggest such an alternative notion. Although prices are constantly changing and never settle to any steady state, we can show that the time aveages of prices will converge, that the process is ergodic, and that a unique limit price distribution will exist. Thus, despite complicated dynamics, there is some structure in the evolution of prices such that, though they never settle down, it is an appropriate concept of equilibrium. Why is this interesting? Because I think this gives us an idea of equilibrium that is not Walrasian in the usual sense, but is specifiable and consistent with the empirical evidence because it also allows us to explain a number of the stylized facts in financial time series such as ‘fat tails’ and ‘long memory.’</p>
<p>Dynamics are important, and assuming away the possibilities of internally generated bubbles in one’s models, as is done by most DSGE models, will give us little insight into how to deal with such bubbles should they actually occur.</p>

            <p>History, Politics, sociology, psychology and anthropology are suggestive, not conclusive, disciplines: they cannot prove (or more importantly disprove) any hypothesis. They should perhaps be more like economics, and economics should be more like them.</p>
<p>Mainstream economics has taught that markets ‘clear’ continuously. The big idea was that if wages and prices are completely flexible, resources will be fully employed. Any shock to the system will result in instantaneous adjustment of wages and prices to the new situation.</p>
<p>For thirty years or so after the Second World War, Keynesian economics ruled the roost, at least in the sense that Keynesian policy – trying to keep economies fully employed and growing on an even keel – was part of the normal toolkit of governments. Then it was thrown out, as economics reverted to its older doctrine that market economies were internally self-correcting and that it was government intervention which make them behave badly. The free-market era of Reagan and Thatcher dawned.</p>
<p>Taking uncertainty seriously – which few economists today do – has profound implications not just for how one does economics and how one applies it, but for one’s understanding of practically all aspects of human activity. It helps explain the rules and conventions by which people live.</p>
<p>The economists’ definition of rational behaviour as behaviour consistent with their own models, with all other behaviour dubbed irrational, amounts to a huge project to reshape humanity into people who believe the things economists believe about them.</p>
<p>Keynes wat not a nationalizer, nor even much of a regulator. He came not exactly to praise capitalism, but certainly not to bury it. He thought that, for all its defects, it was the best economic system on offer, a necessary stage in the passage from scarcity to abundance, from toil to the good life.</p>
<p>The shift in focus from the Keynes of ‘underemployment equilibrium’ to the Keynes of ‘uncertain expectations’ allows for a direct confrontation between contemporary theories of risk and risk management and Keynes’s theory of uncertainty and uncertainty reduction.</p>
<p>As Keynes famously remarked, ‘The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly supposed. Indeed the world is ruled by little else.’</p>
<p>Macroecoomics is divided into two major schools: New Classicals and New Keynesians. The New Keynesians accuse the New Classicals of living in the Dark Ages. The New Classicals accuse the New Keynesians of being pre-Copernican. The two schools are sharply divided over the merits of the ‘stimulus’.</p>
<p>Rational expectations hypothesis (REH) was not intended by its adherents to be a literal description of how people actually behave. One of its leaders, Robert Lucas, had always emphasized the fictional character of his models. The predictive performance of REH models is notoriously had. REH was advanced as a solution to an abstract problem: What conditions of knowledge would be required for markets to be perfectly efficient? Efficiency has always been the normative goal of economics. If the conditions required for market efficiency could be specified, and, over time, realized, then poverty would be eradicated, and the role of government in the economy suitably diminised. Economists therefore set out to build a Platonic world of perfect efficiency, which was nevertheless supposed to have sufficient warrant in terms of human computing abilities and the nature of the universe to make it an acceptable basis for economics theorizing. Unfortunately most policy makers – and even economists – failed to distinguish statements of logical possibility from descriptions of the real world, an ambiguity which REH is happy to accommodate.</p>
<p>The crucial assumption of REH is not perfect competition, but perfect information.</p>
<p>In Alan Greenspan’s words, ‘Probability distributions estimated largely, or exclusively over cycles that do not include periods of panic will underestimate the likelihood of extreme price movements… Furthermore, joint distributions estimated over periods that do not include panics will underestimate correlations between asset returns during panics.’</p>
<p>But Greenspan’s explanation for failure of the models does not go far enough. The failure is not only a matter of limited data: ultimately, it is a matter of limited applicability. One cannot apply insurance models to non-insurable products. </p>
<p>Here is the New Keynesian Joe Stiglitz: ‘Failure in financial markets… have highlighted the importance of informationn imperfection… The results were clear: the financial system failed to perform the functions which it is supposed to perform, allocating capital efficiently and managing risk.’</p>
<p>The dominant economics of the last thirty years encouraged and promoted a system in which financial blizzards like this could occur, and more often than once in a hundred years. It did so from a mistaken belief that all risk can be correctly priced and that therefore financial markets are optimally self-regulating.</p>
<p>Keynes’s particular criticism of the classical school was that it used models which assumed certain things which did not occur in the real world: perfect flexibility of wages and prices, perfect competition, perfect information, and absence of contractual debt – equivalent to absence of money. He rejected the type of reasoning which started with the absence of money (the real-exchange economy) and then ‘added on’ money as a disturbing or complicating factor. Keynes was the first major economist to make money an integral part of economic analysis. It was the primary hedge against uncertainty. His own General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money offered the world a ‘monetary theory of production’. ‘A monetary economy’, he wrote in his preface to that book, ‘is one in which changing views about the future are capable of influencing the quantity of employment and not merely its direction.’ In that pregnant sentence is the core of the Keynesian revolution. </p>
<p>Under capitalism, uncertainty is generated by the system itself, because it is an engine for accumulating capital goods whose rewards come not now but later. The engine of wealth creation is at the same time the source of economic and social instability.</p>
<p>In a stream of letters and articles criticizing the use of econometrics, dating from the late 1930s, Keynes seemed to veer away from the view that there is a map of the future which we can’t yet read to the view that human beings make their own map. He makes for main points:</p>
<p>First, he argues that employing regression analysis to get parameters and then treat them as if they were constant is fundamentally flawed. ‘There is no reason at all why they should not be different every year,’ since we know that many economic relations are ‘nonhomogeneous through time’.</p>
<p>Second, Keynes criticises the ad hoc character of much quantitative modeling. ‘With a free hand to choose coefficients and time lags, one can, with enough industry, always cook a formula to fit moderately well a limited range of past facts. But what does this prove?’ Too much is expected of the data, he continued. It often is not detailed enough to even ‘support one-tenth of the burden which is placed on’.</p>
<p>Third, in sharp contrast to modern economics, Keynes argued that, rather than assuming that quantitative analysis is appropriate when investigating a problem, the default assumption should be the opposite: assume that you cannot use it, and justify the instances when you do. There are simply ‘such important iinfluences which cannot be reduced to statistical form’.</p>
<p>This view underlies his fourth point: there are areas in which statistical analysis can be very useful, but they are limited to simpler, less abstract, relations. ‘The notion of testing the quantitative influence of factors suggested by a theory as being important is very useful and to the point. The question to be answered, however, is whether the complicated method… does not result in a false precision beyond what the method… can support.’ Thus, although credit cycles might be too complex to analyse statistically, Keynes gives the example of the relation between the volume of traffic and the operating costs of a railway system as a case where econometric analysis might warrant some valid conclusions.</p>
<p>The main conclusion to deduce from these points is that Keynes viewed economics as a ‘moral’ science, not a natural science. Although some aspects could be reduced to numbers, much could not. In particular, innovation, a human achievement, destroys regularities. Keynes would have said that it is absurd to rely on risk models based on past data at the moment bankers were creating complex new products every week.</p>
<p>People’s freedom in a monetary economy not to spend money is the crux of his denial of Say’s Law, that production creats its own demand.</p>
<p>He broke up the ‘aggregate demand function’ into two components: consumption demand and investment demand. These these determine the volume of output and employment. Consumption was the stable element in demand, investment the unstable element.</p>
<p>According to Keynes’s ‘psychological law’, when income increases, consumption rises by less than income, and when income decreases consumption falls by less.</p>
<p>Keynes insisted that a decision to save is not equivalent to placing an order for future consumption. His ‘liquidity-preference’ theory of saving is set out in his ‘paradox of thrift’. If everyone wants to save more, firms will sell less and therefore output will fall, unless the inducement to invest is increasing at the same time. So the more ‘thrifty’ a society is, the more difficulty it will have in maintiaing full employment. </p>
<p>Moreover, since recoveries increase the amount saved, simply as a consequence of incomes rising, saving the investment may well be equalized before full employment is regained. This was the basis of Keynes’s view that, under laissez-faire, recoveries are liable to peter out. It is spending, not saving, which creats output and employment; and when spending falls short of earnings, unemployment results.</p>
<p>We assume that the present is a much more serviceable guide to the future than a candid examination of the past experience would show it to have been hitherto. In other words, we largely ignore the prospect of future changes about the actual character of which we know nothing.</p>
<p>We assume that the existing state of opinion, as expressed in prices… is based on a correct summing up of future prospects.</p>
<p>Knowing that our own individual judgement is worthless, we endeavour to fall back on the judgement of the rest of the world, which is perhaps better informed. That is, we endeavour to conform with the behaviour of the majority or the average. The psychology of a society of individuals each of whom is endeavouring to copy the other leads to what we may strictly term a conventional judgement.</p>
<p>The market will be subject to waves of optimistic and pessimistic sentiment, which are unreasoning, yet in a sense legitimate, where no solid basis exists for a reasonable calculation.</p>
<p>The uncertainty attaching to the future yield of investment has given rise to a peculiar institution through which most investment is channelled in a capitalist society: the stock market.</p>
<p>Keynes was here anticipating something which has been subsequently developed by behavioural psychologists: that our tendency to follow the crowd may be ‘hard-wired’. The demand for ‘social proof’ – if people behave in a certain way they must have a reason for doing so – may be a survival instinct.</p>
<p>Trust would not be necessary if all agents had statistically based expectations of other’s behaviour. He placed so much stress on this point precisely because economists ignored the influece of uncertainty in shaping human behaviour and social institutions.</p>
<p>The rate of interest, Keynes writes, is the price which equilibrates the desire to hold wealth in the form of cash with the available quantity of cash.</p>
<p>The economy is not a see-saw, but a leaky balloon.</p>
<p>Keynes conceded that relative price adjustments might come into play in the ‘long period’, but only as a result of the decline in output, not as an alternative to it.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘underemployment equilibrium’ should not be taken too literally. It encapsulates the idea of the lack of an efficacious mechanism for righting economies after a major capsize. It also expresses Keynes’s belief that suboptimal performance is normal, because the growth of economies takes place in the twilight world of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Keynes’s chief domestic prophylactic against uncertainty was what he called ‘cheap money, wise spending’. To offset fluctuations in private investment demand, money should be kept permanently cheap, and the state’s capital budget, which consists of all public, or publicly influenced, investment programmes, should be used to keep total spending at a high level. By contrast, the government’s ‘ordinary’ budget for current spending should normally be in surplus… If this is successful it should not be too difficult to offset small fluctuations by expeditiing or retarding some items in this longer-term programme.’</p>

            <p>Such a science of human action cannot be elaborated either by resource to the methods praised – but never practically resorted to – by the doctorines of logical positivism, historicism, institutionalism, Marxism and Fabianism or by economic history, econometrics and statistics. All that these methods of procedure can establish is history, that is, the description of complex phenomena that happened at a definite place on our globe at a definite date as the consequence of the combined operation of a multitude of factors. From such cognition it is impossible to derive knowledge that could tell us something about the effects to be expected in the future from the application of definite measures and policies, e.g., inflation, price ceilings, or tariffs. But it is precisely this that people want to learn from the study of economics.</p>
<p>The virtue of historical inquiry does not lie in the derivation of laws. Its cognitive value is not to be sought in the possibility of its providing direct practical applications for our action. It deals only with the past; it can never turn toward the future. History makes one wise, but not competent to solve concrete problems.</p>
<p>Psychology, in turning to the individual, found the right starting point. However, its path necessarily leads in another direction than that of the science of human action. The subject matter of the latter is action and what follows from action, whereas the subject matter of psychology is the psychic events that result in action. Economics begins at the point at which psychology leaves off.</p>
<p>However, the universal validity claimed for the proposition also implies applicability to all other past and future occurrences. It is based on an imperfect induction. No universal theorems emerge from perfect induction, but only descriptions of an event that occurred in the past.</p>
<p>However, a mental experiment, logically considered, has an entirely different meaning from a real experiment. It involves thinking through the implications of a proposition in the light of its compatibility with other propositions that we accept as true. If these other propositions are not derived from experience, then the mental experiment makes no reference to experience.</p>
<p>All scientific knowledge in the social realm is derived from experience; it is a generalization drawn from past experience that can always be upset by some later experience. Therefore, the only appropriate method of the social sciences is the specific understanding of the historically unique. There is no knowledge whose validity extends beyond a definite historical epoch or at most beyond several historical epochs.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, in an age that turns its back upon everything that does not, at first glance, apper to be immediately useful, it is out of place to point out that abstract problems of logic and methodology have a close bearing on the life of every individual and on the fate of our entire culture. And it may be no less important to call attention to the fact that no problem of economics or sociology, even if it appears quite simple to superficial consideration, can be fully mastered without reverting to the logical foundations of the science of human action.</p>
<p>It views action and the conditions under which action takes place not in their concrete form, as we encounter them in everyday life, nor in their actual setting, as we view them in each of the sciences of nature and of history, but as formal constructions that enable us to grasp the patterns of human action in their purity.</p>
<p>The theorems of economics are derived not from the observation of facts, but through deduction from the fundamental category of action, which has been expressed sometimes as the economic principle (i.e., the necessity to economize), sometimes as the value principle or as the cost principle. They are of aprioristic derivation ad therefore lay claim to the apodictic certainty that belongs to basic principles so derived.</p>
<p>Consequently, the conformity of the phenomena of the world to natural law must appear to us as the foundation of our human existence, as the ultimate basis of our being human. Thinking about it cannot fill us with fear, but, on the contrary, must comfort us and give us a feeling of security. We are able to act at all – that is to say, we have the power to order our conduct in such a way that the ends we desire can be attained – only because the phenomena of the world are governed not by arbitrariness, but by laws that we have the capacity to know something about. If it were otherwise, we should be completely at the mercy of forces that we should be unable to understand.</p>

            <p>The economists, misled by the logical priority of perfect competition in their scheme, were somehow trapped into thinking that it must be of equal importance in the real world.</p>
<p>Perfect competition prevails when the demand for the output of each producer is perfectly elastic. This entails, first, that the number of sellers is large, so that the output of any one seller is a negligibly small proportion of the total output of the commodity, and second, that buyers are all alike in respect of their choice between rival sellers, so that the market is perfect.</p>
<p>Demand curves – The demand curve for a particular commodity in a given market represents a list of the amounts of that commodity which would be bought at various prices, all other conditions remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>Supply curves – The supply curve of a commodity shows, for each amount of the commodity, the price per unit which it is necessary to pay in order that that amount of it shall be produced.</p>
<p>The demand curve for the output of the individual firm will normally be falling. Its elasticity will depend upon many factors, of which the chief are the number of other firms selling the same commodity and the degree to which substitution is possible, from the point of view of buyers, between the output of other firms and the output of the firm in question.</p>
<p>Perfect competition is never likely to prevail in the production of any actual commodity, but it provides a limiting case of imperfect competition which is of considerable service in analysis. Conditions approximating closely to perfect produce market, such as the corn exchange in a large market town.</p>
<p>A demand curve which continues to be inelastic, however high the price, is obviously an absurdity. There must be some point at which sales begin to fall off rapidly as price is raised, and if a monopolist finds himself faced with an inelastic stretch of the demand curve, he will raise price until the demand begins to become elastic.</p>
<p>If the demand curve is perfectly elastic marginal revenue and price are equal, and the output will be such that marginal cost is equal to price.</p>
<p>It may happen, however, that there are several points of equilibrium, and if he hits upon one of them there will be no tendency for him to move, even though a greater net revenue could be gained at some other point.</p>
<p>Cases of multiple equilibrium may arise when the demand curve changes its slope, being highly elastic for a stretch, then perhaps becoming relatively inelastic, then elastic again. This may happen, for instance, in a market composed of several groups of consumers each with a different level of incomes. There will be several critical points at which a decline in price suddenly brings the commodity within the reach of a whole fresh group of consumers so that the demand curve becomes rapidly more elastic. The marginal revenue curve corresponding to such a demand curve may fall and rise and fall again, and there will be several points of monopoly equilibrium.<br>Moreover, even if the marginal revenue curve falls consistently, the shape of the marginal cost curve may be such that there are several points of equilibrium.</p>
<p>The net monopoly revenue at each point would be different, but it is unlikely that any monopolist would have sufficient knowledge of the situation to enable him to choose the greatest one from among them. If the monopolist had reached one equilibrium point there would be no influence luring him towards another at which his gains might be greater.</p>
<p>If the demand curve is raised in such a way that the second demand curve is iso-elastic with the first, the price will be increased, reduced, or remain the same according as marginal costs are rising, falling, or constant.<br>If marginal costs are constant, and the new demand is less elastic than the old (at the old price), the price will rise; if it is more elastic, the price will fall.</p>
<p>Under increasing supply price, since each additional purchase which the monopsonist makes raises the price which he must pay, the marginal cost to him is greater than the supply price of the commodity. Supply price is average cost to the monopsonist, but he will regulate his purchases by reference to marginal cost.<br>If the industry is working under decreasing supply price, he will find that every increase in his purchases lowers the supply price, and marginal cost to him, which is the same thing as marginal cost to the industry, will be less than the supply price. He will therefore buy more than the competitive amount.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Robinson has said that ‘the two questions to be asked of a set of assumptions in economics are: Are they tractable? and: Do they correspond with the real world?’ Though, as Mrs. Robinson points out, ‘More often one set will be manageable and the other realistic,’ yet there may well be branches of theory where assumptions may be both manageable and realistic.</p>
<p>It is hoped to show in the following paper that a definition of a firm may be obtained which is not only realistic in that it corresponds to what is meant by a firm in the real world, but is tractable by two of the most powerful instruments of economic analysis developed by Marshall, the idea of the margin and that of substitution, together giving the idea of substitution at the margin. Our definition must, of course, ‘relate to formal relations which are capable of being conceived exactly’.</p>
<p>At the margin, the costs of organizing within the firm will be equal either to the costs of organizing in another firm or to the costs involved in leaving the transaction to be ‘organized’ by the price mechanism. Business men will be constantly experimenting, controlling more or less, and in this way, equilibrium will be maintained.</p>
<p>The main points appear in ‘The nature of the firm’: the choice of the transaction as the unit of analysis, the concept of transaction costs, the distinction between the allocation of resources within the firm and through the market, the comparison of the costs of organizing a transaction within the firm and by means of a market transaction, and so on.</p>
<p>Transactions costs and internal labor markets – by Sherwin Rosen</p>
<p>Coase argues that firms exist because some transactions internal to firms are less costly than similar transactions carried out in markets. The limits of the firm depend on cost comparisons at these margins.</p>
<p>If the number of prices necssary to decentralize a complex interactive organization increases multiplicatively with size, then the amount and cost of monitoring required to achieve efficiency also must grow with size. Information becomes garbled as it passes through longer chains, and information channels become congested as chain-of command lengthen (Williamson, 1967). It is the balancing of joint-production and scale economies against increasing costs of control associated with nonmarket transactions costs that determines organization size in traditional theory.</p>
<p>The avoidance of monitoring cost preoccupies the modern literature on agency theory. The main question posed is: Can penalty and reward systems be found  that result in self-enforcing contracts? If so, then internal decentralization may be efficient and the size of firms could be very large indeed. A fundamental result proves that multipart pricing is necessary to induce an agent to behave in the interests of the principal.</p>
<p>Another approach to the principal-agent problem generalizes decentralized output-reward systems to include considerations of risk sharing (Holmstrom, 1979). The problem is set up to investigate the consequences of hidden actions of the agent. The principal cannot observe the agent’s action but can observe the output that is the result of these actions. There cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between output and action or else the principal could infer actions perfectly and the problem is trival. So output is a mixture of random effects and unobserved actions. If output is large, the principal cannot tell if the agent worked very hard or was very lucky. Similarly, a small output could have been due to bad luck rather than shirking.</p>
<p>The interactions of personnel within organizations are too complicated to be completely decentralized through a price mechanism.</p>
<p>The firm’s observed production and cost functions are the outcomes of the interaction between production technology, personnel policy, management, and institutional rules and design.</p>
<p>The flow and direction of personnel through positions in the firm can be thought of as an ‘internal labor market.’ </p>
<p>In large organizations, it is especially important to assign the most capable and energetic people to top-level positions because top-level decisions percolate through the organiztion and have much larger effects on organizational productivity than lower-level decisions do.</p>
<p>The interaction of talent and scale can support extremely large salaries for top-level managers of large firms on marginal productivity grounds alone (Rosen, 1982), consistent with empirical findings that top executive compensation is systematically increasing with firm size (Murphy: Kostiuk) as well as with profitability.</p>
<p>Increasing the difference in wages among the topmost ranking positions maintains incentives by substituting for the option value that propelled performance incentives at lower ranks. In this sense wage structures among top executive positions reflect both the productivity of top-level managers and the productivity induced by the attempts of lower-ranking employees to climb higher.</p>
<p>These bureaucratic costs are properly considered as transactions costs of nonmarket allocations within firms and may ultimately help define the limits of the firm.</p>
<p>The logic of economic organization</p>
<p>Herbert Simon’s contrast between the physical sciences and economics in microanalytic respects is instructive. As he observes (1984:40):<br>In the physical sciences, when errors of measurement and other noise are found to be of the same order of magnitude as the phenomena undre study, the response is not to try to squeeze more information out of the data by statistical means; it is instead to find techniques for observing the phenomena at a higher level of resolution. The corresponding strategy for economics is obvious: to secure new kinds of data at the micro level.</p>
<p>Thansaction cost economics maintains that the microanalytics matter in three basic respects: (1) behavioral assumptions, (2) dimensinoalizing transactions, and (3) process features. </p>
<p>The main case to which transaction cost economics subscries has been stated by Frank Knight as follows:<br>Men in general, and within limits, wish to behave economically, to make their activities and their organization ‘efficient’ rather than wasteful. This fact does deserve the utmost emphasis; and an adequate definition of the science of economics… might well make it explicit that the main relevance of the discussion is found in its relation to social policy, assumed to be directed toward the end indicated, of increasing economic efficiency, of reducing waste.</p>
<p>Alfred Chandler’s summary of the defects of the large unitary form (U-form) enterprise, to which the multidivisional (M-form) enterprise was a response, is pertinent (1962):<br>The inherent weakness in the centralized, functionally departmentalized operating company… became critical only when the administrative load on the senior executives increased to such an extent that they were unable to handle their entrepreneurial responsibilities efficiently. This situation arose when the operations of the enterprise became too complex and the problems of coordination, appraisal, and policy formulation too intricate for a small number of top officers to handle both long-run, entrepreneurial, and short-run operational administrative activities.</p>
<p>Transaction cost economics insists that the process features of organization be examined in the context of specific contractual relationships. Greater knowledge of and attention to microanalytic detail is thus required.</p>

            <p>More directly, the forms and kinds of property rights sanctioned in a society define or identify the kinds of competition, discrimination or behavior characteristic of that society.</p>
<p>A property right for me means some protection against other people’s choosing against my will one of the uses of resources, said to mine.</p>
<p>If there were no costs of negotiating such exchanges of rights and policing them, the initial partitioning of rights would not affect the way resources are used. (by Ronald Coase)</p>
<p>The two derivative implications are:<br>(1) concentration of rewards and costs more directly on each person responsible for them, and<br>(2) comparative advantage effects of specialized applications of (a) knowledge in control and (b) of risk bearing.</p>
<p>But if people differ in any of these respects, as they in fact do, it can be shown that specialization in various tasks – including that of owning a business – will increase wealth.</p>
<p>Ownership ability includes attitude toward risk bearing, knowledge of different people’s productive abilities, foresight and, of course, judgement.</p>
<p>But public ownership practically eliminates possibilities of specialization among owners – though not of employees in the publicly owned venture.</p>
<p>We are not arguing that private property even in its purest form is perfect in the cost-bearing sense. No standard of perfection is available. All of our statements have been comparative in degrees of cost bearing.</p>
<p>The presence of one kind of relative deficiency does not justify a switch to another agency – which has other kinds of deficiencies.</p>
<p>As we suggested earlier, public and private ownership are used for different purposes, and in some cases because of these different behavioral implications.</p>

            <p>A Critique of welfare economics and the implications for public policy</p>
<p>The Author<br>Professor Cheung’s main approach to research is empirical – he formulates hypotheses and then tests their implications against evidence. His conviction of the importance of property rights in affecting economic behaviour has led to an almost exclusive focus on various aspects of transaction costs. As a price theorist, Professor Cheung typically specifies alternative sets of transaction costs in deriving his hypotheses, and then proceeds to test the implications through thorough investigations of the real-world situations.</p>
<p>Transaction costs may arise as a consequence of </p>
<ul>
<li>first, the inadequate specification of property rights;</li>
<li>second, the nature of the externality;</li>
<li>third, the number of bargarners; and / or</li>
<li>fourth, the inadequacy of the institutions</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Inadequate definition of property rights<br>Without this initial delimitation of property rights, there will be no market transactions – exchange or ‘trade’ – to transfer and recombine them. A clear-cut decision on property rights may thus itself be all that is required to resolve the difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Uncertain effect of externality<br>Where the externality itself is complex and even ambiguous, so that the individuals do not know whether an activity is detrimental or beneficial to themselves, it is impossible to strike a bargain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Bargaining costs<br>Transaction costs may frequently increase with the number of individuals both as a result of increased difficulties in locating all involved and of accurately revealing their preferences.<br>On the assumption of zero transaction costs, Professor Coase argued that the efficient solution would be attained by bargaining irrespective of the initial delimitation of rights. Once there are transaction costs, the effects are less clear-cut.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Failure of legal and political institutions<br>Finally, the transaction costs of resolving an externality problem may be high as a consequence of inadequae institutions. Inevitably, this issue has dominated the debate on policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The most obvious instrument of policy, once property rights are established and bargaining has failed, is court action. In an ideal world, it would suffice. But, in practice, British courts are less than helpful.</p>
<p>Fundamental issues<br>First, no-one should expect that governments will behave simply as social agencies whose sole or primary purpose is to maximise welfare.<br>Second, the evidence is mounting that government sector interventions are themselves excessively costly. The costs of intervention will often exceed the benefits.<br>Third, government should not be assumed to command more knowledge than the individuals affected.<br>Fourth, the implications for individual freedom should not be ignored when assessing the argument for government interention.</p>
<p>On ethics, economic theory must remain silent: no testable propositions can be put forward unless each individual’s judgement is accepted as given. In the seemingly persuasive argument for redistribution of income, economic analysis has failedo produce a convincing measure of a net improvement in ‘welfare’ when $1 of every $100 is taken from one person and given to another.</p>
<p>To accept or to deny the desirability of a public policy necessarily involves ‘normative’ value-judgements on whether it should (or should not) be adopted. Economic efficiency, on the other hand, can be defined in ‘positive’ terms concerned with whether a certain activity is (or is not) efficient. The transition from positive analysis to normative argument on policy requires only the inference that efficient allocation of resources is desirable to society. This inference is easy to draw and, to most economists, easy to accept.</p>
<p>The disagreements usually stem not from conflicting analytical tools but rather from different assumptions. </p>
<p>Pareto condition: a state where it is no longer possible to re-allocate the use of resources so that one individual will gain without loss to another.</p>
<p>The term ‘economic efficiency’ in its standard usage refers to the attainment of maximum aggregate value of goods and services, or maximum value of the scarce resources used to produce them.</p>
<p>A central postulate in economic analysis is that each individual will maximise his real income (or gain) subject to limitations or ‘constraints’, the term used here to include all the factors which restrain an individual from achieving an infinitely high income. They comprise four groups:<br>(1) scarcity of resources;<br>(2) diminishing returns – nature’s law which dictates that one cannot produce an infinite quantity of grain by continuing to add fertilizer to a given piece of land;<br>(3) property rights, which stem from competition for the same resources;<br>(4) transaction costs, which include the costs of searching, negotating and enforcing contracts, and of defining and policing of rights.</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe always efficient</p>
<p>The validity of assumptions in economic analysis has been a confusing issue. An ‘assumption’ sometimes refers to a postulate which cannot be observed, and it is pointless then to question its reality.</p>
<p>Assuming constraints that fail to conform essentially to reality has been a major fallacy in the analysis of social cost.</p>
<p>In Coase’s view therefore, the problem is a reciprocal one, and on efficiency grounds the solution is not simply to restrain the damaging party, but to restrain either the damaging or the damaged party in such a way that the gain for one side cannot be outweighted by the loss to the other, in total and at the margin.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for the consummation of any transaction is that the maximum one party is willing to pay to acquire a right is more than, or at least equal to, the minimum another party is willing to accept to surrender that right.</p>
<p>A more general statement can now be made regarding the constraints under which the traditional measure of economic efficiency will be attained.<br>First, assignment of exclusive rights to either A or B is essential, and either case will yield similar result.<br>(The alternative assignments of rights, involving alternative liability rules and different distributions of wealth, could lead to different patterns of resource use due to the distribution effects, but this would not affect efficiency.)<br>A second constraint is that all costs associated with making transactions ar zero.<br>These two propositions summarise what has been called the Coase theorem.</p>
<p>Complications</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncertain transaction costs<br>Either party may capture the entire amount; but no criterion or mechanism is specified through which a division may be determined, and without an answer to this question we cannot predict the behavior of the individual parties.<br>Bilateral monopoly<br>The important conclusion is that the solution becomes mechanical once the nature and magnitude of transaction costs, together with other constraints, are sufficiently specified.</li>
<li>High transaction costs<br>If transaction costs are prohibitive or even sizeable, the arbitrary assignment of rights influences the use of resources and the gain to society.<br>The mere attainment of a contract, therefore, is not a priori evidence of a move toward more efficient use of resources; conversely, the absence of contracting may enhance efficiency.<br>Indeed, even if the costs of private contracting were insignificant, a government might still decide to intervene. Economic analysis has thu far failed to predict the circumstances under which government action will incur lower (or higher) costs than those resulting from private contracting.</li>
<li>Absence of diminishing returns<br>This complication demonstrates not only that alternative assignments of rights may affect resource allocation when the transaction costs are positive, but also that the transaction costs incurred may vary with alternative assignments of rights.</li>
<li>Unlimited property rights / prohibitive transaction costs</li>
</ol>
<p>No hard line seperates limitations of rights which are matters of private contracting from those which fall withinn the jurisdiction of the court or the coercion of government. (Indeed, the very definition of ‘government’ is itself still subject to debate and conjecture.) But whatever government is, its economic role in society must remain unclear until we can pinpoint the activities where governmental intervention incurs lower costs than private contracting.</p>
<p>In specifying the constraints sufficient to yield testable implications for the interpretation of behaviour, two requirements must be met.<br>First, the constraints must be identifiable by observation. Thus, any empirically useful definition of property rights must provide observable situations where changes in rights occur.<br>A second requirement, if property rights are to be useful in economic theorising, is that they be defined in such a way that (given constrained maximisation) changes in behaviour can be derived as a result of changes of rights.</p>
<p>A good or an asset is defined to be private property if, and only if, three distinct sets of rights are associated with its ownership.<br>First, the exclusive right to use (or to decide how to use) the good may be viewed as the right to exclude other individuals from its use.<br>Second is the exclusive right to receive income generated by the use of the good.<br>Third, the full right to transfer, or freely ‘alienate’, its ownership includes the right to enter into contracts and to choose their form.<br>This structure of rights which defines private property is, of course, an idealisation intended for economic theorising; in practice, exclusivity and transferability are matters of degree.</p>
<p>If behaviour is to be interpreted in terms of economic principles, the most basic requirement is that we be able to identify any changing pattern of these rights so that implications can be derived for corresponding changes in contractual behaviour, resource allocation, and income distribution.</p>
<p>In the broadest sense of the term, ‘transaction costs’ comprise those that cannot be conceived to exist in a Crusoe economy.<br>The term then includes not only the costs of forming and enforcing contracts (including seeking information for market transactions), but also the costs of delineating and policing exclusive rights (including those of institutional arrangements such as legislative enactments). This wide definition is essential, for it is difficult (and, insofar as we know, impossible) to separate the cost of exchange from the cost of defining rights to the resource to be exchanged. </p>
<p>A more useful method, of course, is to propose generalised functions of transaction costs which may be systematically applied to a larger number of situations. This task is onerous, as the current state of the art amply demonstrates.</p>
<p>The issue if not divergence itself, but the reliability of the observations used to illustrate it. If to a significant extent these observations are untrue, economists have tried to explain things which do not exist and have formulated policies largely inappropriate for application.</p>
<p>J. L. Buck<br>Contrary to the prevailing opinion that tenants do not farm as well as owners, a classification according to yields by different types of tenure shows no significant variation in yields for most localities, and for the few in which a difference does occur, it is in favour of the tenant or part-owner as often as for the owner…. In some places, even, it is evident that the tenants farm better than the owners.</p>
<p>The lack of significant variation between owner and tenant cultivation in the data presented does not imply that the costs of negotiating and enforcing tenant contracts in China or elsewhere are trivial, or that they will not affect observations in some decisive ways. But, while recognising these transaction costs, we must not jump to the conclusion that tenant farming will be less productive than owner farming.<br>Whether transaction costs will significantly affect behaviour depends upon their impact on resource use at the margin. With or without such costs, maximisation may imply the same marginal equality: namely, for the use of crucial farming resources the marginal return to the input committed equals its marginal opportunity cost.<br>It is true that transaction costs incurred are generally higher with tenant than with owner cultivation, but there is no reason to predict that they are of such proportion or nature that they significantly affect resource use at the crucial margin.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to estimate the standard sets of marginal values which an efficient market is said to equate: the burden of such a task must rest upon those who believe the government can costlessly and accurately make these estimates for the imposition of the ‘ideal’ tax-subsidy schemes.</p>
<p>But any government action can be speciously justified on efficiency grounds by the simple expedient of assuming that transaction costs in the market are high and that costs of governmental control are low.</p>
<p>The common fallacies are that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the constraints assumed have largely been invalid</li>
<li>the observations reported have often been incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p>The thesis here is simply that any valuable application of economic theory must rest upon careful empirical investigation to ensure that the facts are true, that the hypotheses are testable, and that the tests are performed.</p>
<p>Analyses designed to assist policy-making need not be inconsistent with those designed to interpret behaviour.</p>
<p>It is always possible in principle to define (i.e., set up) a system of private rights in property. But in some cases it would still be prohibitively expensive for the owners to police and enforce their rights, given the technical difficulties.</p>
<p>John Burton<br>What conclusions may we draw for public policy?<br>First, the Pigovian policy rule – that externalities necessitate ‘corrective’ government action – is dangerously over-simplistic. It is incorrect as a general rule for efficiency in resource allocation. Its application often leads to a more serious misallocation of resources than that arising from the externalities which government action is supposed to correct.<br>Second the Pigovian analysis contains an implicit bias towards ‘intervention solutions’ for externalities, in the form of taxes, subsidies, regulations and prohibitions.<br>Third, recognition of the fundamental role of attenuations of private property rights in generating externalities leads to consideration of the alternative policy of re-defining property rights. The advantages of this approach are that it harnesses the incentives for individuals, and the relative cheapness of the price system as a means of generating and utilising information, in the interests of conservation.<br>A private property approach is not applicable in all instances, but insufficient attention has been paid in the past to the possibilities of applying it.</p>
<p>The general conclusion for public policy is the classical one:<br>given the inherent defects, complexity, cost and bias of an intervention solution, the general rule should be to let the price system deal with externalities wherever possible: by re-defining property rights and removing barriers to trade due to externalities. Government intervention – domestic or supramational – is best kept as a ‘solution of the last resort’: to be used only when and where high and irreducible transaction costs prevent the internalisation of externalities by private action. Even on these grounds, government intervention must be carefully scrutinised, because the costs and external side effects may outweigh the benefits.<br>The mere existence of externalities thus does not, despite Professor Samuelson, provide ‘a clear case for some kind of public intervention’.</p>

            <p>I have for this purpose defined chronic inflation as a condition in which price increases of more than 20 percent per annum have been typical over an extended period.</p>
<p>Two key lessons flow from Table 1.<br>The first is that there is a close relationship between the rate of inflation and the rate of increase in the money supply.<br>The second is that the rate of monetary expansion tends, even in these chronic inflations, to be greater than the rate of increase of prices.</p>
<p>However, we know too, from common sense and from experience, that inflation operates as a tax on holdings of money. Thus it is also reasonable that the size of real cash balances should be less in an inflationary environment than it would be if there were little or no inflation. This tendency for inflation itself to lead people to economize on their holdings of cash does not show up in the data for chronic inflations. This can be explained in either of two ways.<br>First, people reduce their cash balances in the process of adapting to an inflationary situation. Once they have made their adaption – say by reducing their average bank balance from six weeks’ income to four weeks’ income, they will tend to stay at the new level unless the rate of inflation goes up. Therefore if we observe a country that has an inflation rate of 30 percent per year in the mid-1950s, and continues oscillating around that level into the mid 1960s, we should not expect people to be reducing their real cash holdings in the interim. The reduction would have occurred earlier – in the process of getting from zero or low rates of inflation up to 30 percent.<br>The second reason underlying the observation that the money supply has risen more rapidly than the price level during periods of chronic inflation is simply that the forces of population growth and rising real income levels continue to work even in an inflationary setting. Their effects cumulate through time, and when a long span of years is involved they can easily outweigh the tendency for an increased rate of inflation to cause people to reduce their cash holdings.</p>
<p>Thus we have (1) similarity of rates within each period among the industrial countries, (2) similarity of rates within each period between the selected LDC’s and the industrial countries, and (3) a significant change in the pace of inflation between periods. I believe that one must recognize from these figures the validity of the notion of a ‘world inflation.’ It is not by accident that so many countries have moved, almost in lock-step, through successive, closely similar inflationary experiences. Much more plausible is the idea that they were co-participants in a common process of world inflation.</p>
<p>This interpretation is further strengthened when it is realized that for most of the period under review the bulk of the world was on a system of fixed exchange rates. And just as the cause of inflation in Illinois cannot differ much from that of inflation in Ohio, so long as both states share a common currency and allow goods and services to move freely in and out, so too the cause of inflation in Costa Rica or Iran or the Philippines cannot be very different from that of the ‘world inflation’ so long as they maintain a fixed exchange rate with the major currencies, and so long as they do not introduce dramatic new interferences with the movement of goods and services.</p>
<p>Then in the period since 1973 the major currencies have all floated vis-avis one another, making the notion of a world money supply even more of an abstraction. Yet I still believe that the notion is a good one, generating insights that lead to more fruitful interpretations of reality than the alternative of assuming that each country’s monetary authorities behaved independently. Even though we have ahd nearly five years of floating rates, it is my impression that the monetary authorities of the major countries have behaved with far less independence than the theorists of floating rates are prone to assume. Consequently, in terms of the way the international monetary system has worked since 1973, I would characterize it as a hybrid, functioning if anything more like a fixed-exchange-rate system than like a textbook case of floating rates.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, then, a government intent on borrowing from the banking system at a rate more rapid than that compatible with stable prices, is going to have to expand the money supply at an inflationary pace. This has been the historic source of nearly all chronic and acute inflations.</p>
<p>The reasons why private-sector credit inflations get started (and keep going) are harder to understand than those relating to inflations caused principally by fiscal deficits. Usually there is some entity that has the power to expand credit without being subject to stern control by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The thought is that credit which is for productive purposes is not inflationary, a notion sometimes dubbed ‘the real bills doctrine.’ Plausible though it may appear at first glance, the proposition does not survive close examination. A country’s money supply will typically be equal to something between one and two months’ income. An effort to extend credit equal to even three or four months’ production would be frustrated by inflation, unless the credit came from outside the monetary system. This is so simply because people would not be willing to hold three or four months’ income in the form of money balances.</p>
<p>The rapid rise in international reserves, which started in 1969, stemmed from a variety of causes. The expansion of the supply of United States dollars (which have been for half a century the key currency in the international system) accelerated somewhat under the strains of the Vietnam War. Simutaneously, the world banking system created important new supplies of dollars (Eurodollars) and of some other currencies (German marks, Swiss francs) as it expanded its lending operations denominated in these moneys. Quite independently, but more or less at the same time, there was a significant growth of SDRs (Special Drawing Rights), the new ‘world money’ created within and by the International Monetary Fund to add to the supply of international reserves. Finally, in the mid-1970s there was an expansion of lending by the International Monetary Fund to the Central Banks of its member countries, most of it under the rubric of the IMF Oil Facility, a series of credits advanced to the countries that were hardest hit by the dramatic oil price rise of 1974.</p>
<p>Three effects now enter the picture, all produced by the disequilibrium situation just described:<br>a) People will attempt to reconstitute the shortfall in their real cash balances, simply by spending less than normal for a time. Part of this reduction in spending will fall on purely domestic goods, but part will fall on traded goods, thus inducing a tendency to surplus in the balance of payments and a consequent ‘importation of money.’<br>b) People will also attempt to reconstitute their shortfall of real cash by borrowing. This can be accomplished either through the domestic monetary authorities permitting the expnsion of credit (and money supply), or through borrowing from abroad. If the domestic expansion takes place rapidly enough, this can forestall all the other adjustment mechanisms by itself ‘financing’ a rise of domestic goods prices to match that of traded goods. But to the extent borrowing from abroad is also involved, this second avenue of adjustment also entails an ‘importation of money.’<br>c) Finally, to the extent that neither (a) nor (b) succeeds in rapidly bringing domestic prices into line with world prices, there will be a substitution effect at work, causing people to shift their expenditures away from internationally traded and toward purely domestic goods and services, once again producing an improvement in the balance of payments and an ‘importation of money.’</p>
